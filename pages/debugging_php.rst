Leveling up your PHP debugging skills
=====================================

Are you feeling terribly unproductive when trying to fix bugs in your program?

Are you constantly perplexed when your colleague finds that bug you are
searching for in a matter of seconds - AGAIN - and you don't understand how he
got there?

You are not alone.

Seeing the students I hired at my company or participants at my workshops, they
are all struggling to find the source of a bug when it is obvious for me where
to look or how to fix it, because I have already learned a strategy to squash
that problem as fast as possible.

In this category of my blog I want to write about my experience with debugging
strategies in more detail, and try to pass my knowledge, strategies and
techniques on.

Watch out for the first post coming up here soon!
