            <h1><a href="2009/01/11/howto-file-a-good-bug-report-suggestions-for-framework-users.html">Howto file a good bug report: Suggestions for framework users</a></h1>
<p>I have fixed quite a number of bugs for the ZF lately, which lead me to
this post about how to file a good bug report. There are many annoying
bug reports out there, where the reporter of the bug withholds important
information to the bugfixer unintended. This advice applies bug reports
in general of course.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of a good bug report? The bug generally gets fixed
faster, when the developer has more information at hand. Additionally
other developers might come to rescue since they can understand the
issue faster. These benefits are good for both parties. If you take no
time for a good bug report, your issue might risk to end up getting old
or closed unfixed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Post the whole Exception Stack Trace</strong>: If the library throws an
Exception into your application that is unexpected and may indicate
an bug: Do not post the Message or Exception name only. The exception
may be thrown in many different places or due to different reasons.
The PHP exception class offers the method <strong>getTraceAsString()</strong>,
which offers many information to the developer what the cause of the
exception might be. Please use it!</li>
<li><strong>Post codefixes in a patch format</strong>: When you find a bug in the
framework, it is quite possible that you can offer a fix directly.
Writing “Replace x in line y with z” does not help very often. The
component might be in flux and the line positions change more often
than you think. Please create a diff file of this changes that
indicate the precise position of the change. This diff also includes
2 lines above and below the patched code for direction of the
developer. SVN Diffs are even more useful since they include the
revision where you fixed the bug in.</li>
<li><strong>Post reproducible cases as PHPUnit Test</strong>: If you find a bug and
can show how to reproduce it: Write a unittest to prove it. It is ZF
policy to create a unittest for each bugfix showing that the bug was
indeed fixed and previous functionality remains the same, so this
unit-test has to be written anyways. Many show-offs rely on massive
<strong>echo</strong> statements or <strong>var_dump</strong>, which render them almost
useless for the developer.</li>
<li><strong>Attach a unit-test to a submitted patch</strong>: This is related to the
previous point. If you add a unit test your patch will get more
attention. It will prove that you have thought about the patch, its
consequences and that you might have checked it does not break
backwards compatibility. This is worth a lot.</li>
<li><strong>Run the test suite with your patch</strong>: If you want to provide a
patch. Run the testsuite of the Zend Framework. It might break
expected behaviour. When you post a patch that will break BC, it will
be recognized. Your bug report might be closed, which helps nobody.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you find a bug you have probably thought about it and how to fix
it. This is valuable information. Disregarding one of this points will
lead to missing information on part of the developer that he has to
“learn” again. This takes time, which may make your bug last longer than
it should.</p>

<p>In February or March 2009 the 1.8 version of the <a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend
Framework</a> is scheduled to be released. I
have contributed some stuff already regarding ZendX_JQuery and
Zend_Soap.</p>
<p>Both components have seen numerous bugfixes and I managed to get the
JQuery helper down to zero open issues. I have also taken over the
<a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Json_Expr+to+allow+Javascript+Expressions+(functions)+to+be+encoded+using+Zend_Json">Zend_Json_Expr
proposal</a>,
which will be a huge benefit to everything JSON that can be done with
ZF. Foremost it is an integral part for the jQuery component which
heavily relies on javascript callbacks.</p>
<p>The Soap Autodiscover and WSDL classes compatibility with Java and .NET
has been optimized due to great user feedback, as well as some bugfixes
to the newly added WSDL type detection strategies.</p>
<p>Additionally I went on another bug killing spree and fixed around 20-30
old bugs in a wide range of different components.</p>

            <h1><a href="2009/01/12/on-publishing-webservices-within-mvc-frameworks.html">On Publishing Webservices within MVC Frameworks</a></h1>
<p>Webservices are a very important part in today’s enterprise applications.
They tie applications of different age or programming languages together
or allow applications of different subcontracters to speak to each
other. Because they use HTTP, a stateless network protocol, considerable
overhead floods the pipes when you use them, which should be minimized.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com">Martin Fowler</a> writes in his <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/">PEAA
book</a>, that if you have the
option not to use distributed objects (which are implemented via
webservice) you should not distribute them. Considerable effort has to
be brought into keeping complex webservices performant.</p>
<p>Still people make mistakes about webservices all the time (me included
for example proposing a dispatcher for the ZF that could be used for
webservices).</p>
<p>When people report problems with the Zend Soap component they often post
a stripped down example that involes their webservice being instantiated
within a controller. This is a very bad decision based on different
arguments:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Dispatching overhead</strong>: Dispatching, Routing, Pre- and
Postfiltering is costly in all frameworks. You give up the
performance of having numerous PHP scripts that act as controller on
their own. You get centralized filtering, authentication and other
benefits. But those benefits generally do not aply to XML, JSON or
SOAP requests, because you cannot parse them or access their
properties. You give up the performance of a page controller for
webservices to gain mostly nothing.</li>
<li><strong>HTTP Request uselessness</strong>: Web frameworks work with HTTP request
objects. The request of webservices facilitates HTTP to act as a far
more complex request. No framework I know off, allows to work with
the webservice requests outside the Webservice handler. What a SOAP
or XML-RPC request does in your MVC is only get passed through
numerous costly stages that offer no benefit, before it hits the
target. Only the parsing of HTTP-Headers might offer additional
benefit, but the gain is low, since they are available to PHP scripts
at no cost.</li>
<li><strong>Webservices already seperate concerns</strong>: Take the PHP SOAPServer as
an example. It is an MVC application on its own, the controlling
aspect of the SOAPServer parses the SOAP Request and sends it to the
model, a class given by the user, which in turn works and returns the
result as an SOAP Response View. You have to decouple model and view
for a webservice handler otherwise it would generate invalid
responses. Why nest a perfectly separated operation into another one?
You gain no more of this additional separation, except performance
decrease.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what are good practices to implement webservices?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use a page controller that generates no MVC overhead. In context of
the Zend Framework: Add a new php script to your web root and add a
new route into your .htaccess file that redirectes the desired
location of the webservice to the script that overwrites the standard
catch-all incoming requests to the front controller script.</li>
<li>Use the proxy pattern and the invaluable __call() method to
implement wrapper objects for authentication and session management
of the webservice. These classes can easily be reused by all
webservice page controllers of your site. If you do your homework you
can even share parts of these objects inside your Web-MVC application
to keep the code DRY. Those proxies keep authentication logic out of
your service class.</li>
<li>Use the remote facade pattern to implement a few, powerful methods
that delegate the service request to underlying domain objects. Never
ever publish direct access to domain objects with your webservices.
As a rule of thumb, talking to a webservice during a logical
operation should never involve more than one or two calls. The first
call is for data fetching, the second for data saving. Authentication
should be handled via HTTP Authentication to save an additional call.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you follow these simple rules, you should get around the performance
issues that generally come with webservices, without loosing flexibility
at all.</p>

<p>I have been tagged by
<a class="reference external" href="http://dolfschimmel.freeaqingme.com/?p=78">Freeaqingme</a> and the blog
letter machinery. So read on for seven things you probably may not know
about me.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I will get my degree in some weeks, currently intensively writting on
my thesis. My major is economics though. I probably won’t get a job
with that sooner or later. I actually don’t want to, I have a job as
programmer already.</li>
<li>One christmas many years ago (Pentium PCs to 200Mhz were the coolest
thing around) i wished and wished for a computer for playing Command
and Conquer and stuff. What i got was a 3/86 i could only run crap
with. So i had to start programming.</li>
<li>In 11th grade (7 years ago) I took part in the german computer
science olympics (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bwinf.de/uploads/media/bwi20/runde1/20bwinf.pdf">exercise still
online</a>)
using PHP and writing thousands of lines of nested aray and for loop
code and print the solution to the browser. No need to say I utterly
failed, because I didn’t know a bit about algorithms, pointers and
objects at all.</li>
<li>I have only learned about what good programming practices are (OO,
functional, whatever) really means in the last two years, spending
almost every free minute of those many i had on projects to test
around with patterns and programming styles.</li>
<li>I went to my first conference last year september, the IPC in Mainz,
getting to know lots of great people in the community.</li>
<li>I don’t have a license at all (<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.libssh2.org/index.php?/archives/122-Seven-Things.html">Reference to
Sara</a>).
I am afraid of driving cars, although I drive my bike through the
biggest crossroads in town like nuts.</li>
<li>I am a timeline oriented reader, having made me masterplans to read
both all the Discworld and Ian Rankin novels in the correct order to
not miss a single reference.</li>
</ul>
<p>Its sad that everyone I would want to tag was already tagged by someone
else, still for the head count:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew/">Matthew Weierophinney</a>, because
he helped me understand Zend Framework alot.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.dasprids.de/">Ben Scholzen</a>, because he is a fun guy to

<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.thomasweidner.com/flatpress/">Thomas Weidner</a>, because
I like his dedication towards his ZF components.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://kore-nordmann.de/blog.html">Kore Nordmann</a>, Bastian Feder
and Thomas Weinert, because I had great discussions with him on IPC.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://codeutopia.net/blog/">zomg aka Jani</a> because of his skills

<p>I am in a dilemma. I have condemned the usage of Zend_Soap_Server (or
any other webservice server handler) <a class="reference external" href="http://www.whitewashing.de/blog/articles/106">inside a Model-View-Controller
application</a> before.
Still I get questions about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.whitewashing.de/blog/articles/65">my old Zend_Soap_Server and
Zend_Soap_AutoDiscover
example</a> not working in
the MVC scenario. The following example provides you with a working Soap
server inside a Zend_Controller_Action, although I discourage the use
of it and would suggest using a dedicated script outside the dispatching
process to gain multitudes of performance, which webservices often
require.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>require_once "/path/to/HelloWorldService.php";

class MyDiscouragedSoapServerController extends Zend_Controller_Action
{
    public function serverAction()
    {
        $server = new Zend_Soap_Server("http://example.com/pathto/wsdl");
        $server-&gt;setClass('HelloWorldService');
        $server-&gt;handle();
    }

    public function wsdlAction()
    {
        $wsdl = new Zend_Soap_AutoDiscover();
        $wsdl-&gt;setUri('http://example.com/pathto/server');
        $wsdl-&gt;setClass('HelloWorldService');
        $wsdl-&gt;handle();
    }
}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now all you have to do is create two routes, one that makes
<strong>http://example.com/pathto/server</strong> point to
<strong>MyDiscouragedSoapServerController::serverAction</strong> and the other route
that makes <strong>http://example.com/pathto/wsdl</strong> point to
<strong>MyDiscouragedSoapServerController::wsdlAction</strong>. The wrong version
(Version Mismatch) error comes from sending a request for the WSDL file
to the actual Soap Server, which he doesn’t like.</p>
