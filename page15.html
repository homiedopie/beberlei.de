<p>In February or March 2009 the 1.8 version of the <a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend
Framework</a> is scheduled to be released. I
have contributed some stuff already regarding ZendX_JQuery and
Zend_Soap.</p>
<p>Both components have seen numerous bugfixes and I managed to get the
JQuery helper down to zero open issues. I have also taken over the
<a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Json_Expr+to+allow+Javascript+Expressions+(functions)+to+be+encoded+using+Zend_Json">Zend_Json_Expr
proposal</a>,
which will be a huge benefit to everything JSON that can be done with
ZF. Foremost it is an integral part for the jQuery component which
heavily relies on javascript callbacks.</p>
<p>The Soap Autodiscover and WSDL classes compatibility with Java and .NET
has been optimized due to great user feedback, as well as some bugfixes
to the newly added WSDL type detection strategies.</p>
<p>Additionally I went on another bug killing spree and fixed around 20-30
old bugs in a wide range of different components.</p>

            <h1><a href="2009/01/12/on-publishing-webservices-within-mvc-frameworks.html">On Publishing Webservices within MVC Frameworks</a></h1>
<p>Webservices are a very important part in today’s enterprise applications.
They tie applications of different age or programming languages together
or allow applications of different subcontracters to speak to each
other. Because they use HTTP, a stateless network protocol, considerable
overhead floods the pipes when you use them, which should be minimized.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com">Martin Fowler</a> writes in his <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/">PEAA
book</a>, that if you have the
option not to use distributed objects (which are implemented via
webservice) you should not distribute them. Considerable effort has to
be brought into keeping complex webservices performant.</p>
<p>Still people make mistakes about webservices all the time (me included
for example proposing a dispatcher for the ZF that could be used for
webservices).</p>
<p>When people report problems with the Zend Soap component they often post
a stripped down example that involes their webservice being instantiated
within a controller. This is a very bad decision based on different
arguments:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Dispatching overhead</strong>: Dispatching, Routing, Pre- and
Postfiltering is costly in all frameworks. You give up the
performance of having numerous PHP scripts that act as controller on
their own. You get centralized filtering, authentication and other
benefits. But those benefits generally do not aply to XML, JSON or
SOAP requests, because you cannot parse them or access their
properties. You give up the performance of a page controller for
webservices to gain mostly nothing.</li>
<li><strong>HTTP Request uselessness</strong>: Web frameworks work with HTTP request
objects. The request of webservices facilitates HTTP to act as a far
more complex request. No framework I know off, allows to work with
the webservice requests outside the Webservice handler. What a SOAP
or XML-RPC request does in your MVC is only get passed through
numerous costly stages that offer no benefit, before it hits the
target. Only the parsing of HTTP-Headers might offer additional
benefit, but the gain is low, since they are available to PHP scripts
at no cost.</li>
<li><strong>Webservices already seperate concerns</strong>: Take the PHP SOAPServer as
an example. It is an MVC application on its own, the controlling
aspect of the SOAPServer parses the SOAP Request and sends it to the
model, a class given by the user, which in turn works and returns the
result as an SOAP Response View. You have to decouple model and view
for a webservice handler otherwise it would generate invalid
responses. Why nest a perfectly separated operation into another one?
You gain no more of this additional separation, except performance
decrease.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what are good practices to implement webservices?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use a page controller that generates no MVC overhead. In context of
the Zend Framework: Add a new php script to your web root and add a
new route into your .htaccess file that redirectes the desired
location of the webservice to the script that overwrites the standard
catch-all incoming requests to the front controller script.</li>
<li>Use the proxy pattern and the invaluable __call() method to
implement wrapper objects for authentication and session management
of the webservice. These classes can easily be reused by all
webservice page controllers of your site. If you do your homework you
can even share parts of these objects inside your Web-MVC application
to keep the code DRY. Those proxies keep authentication logic out of
your service class.</li>
<li>Use the remote facade pattern to implement a few, powerful methods
that delegate the service request to underlying domain objects. Never
ever publish direct access to domain objects with your webservices.
As a rule of thumb, talking to a webservice during a logical
operation should never involve more than one or two calls. The first
call is for data fetching, the second for data saving. Authentication
should be handled via HTTP Authentication to save an additional call.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you follow these simple rules, you should get around the performance
issues that generally come with webservices, without loosing flexibility
at all.</p>

<p>I have been tagged by
<a class="reference external" href="http://dolfschimmel.freeaqingme.com/?p=78">Freeaqingme</a> and the blog
letter machinery. So read on for seven things you probably may not know
about me.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I will get my degree in some weeks, currently intensively writting on
my thesis. My major is economics though. I probably won’t get a job
with that sooner or later. I actually don’t want to, I have a job as
programmer already.</li>
<li>One christmas many years ago (Pentium PCs to 200Mhz were the coolest
thing around) i wished and wished for a computer for playing Command
and Conquer and stuff. What i got was a 3/86 i could only run crap
with. So i had to start programming.</li>
<li>In 11th grade (7 years ago) I took part in the german computer
science olympics (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bwinf.de/uploads/media/bwi20/runde1/20bwinf.pdf">exercise still
online</a>)
using PHP and writing thousands of lines of nested aray and for loop
code and print the solution to the browser. No need to say I utterly
failed, because I didn’t know a bit about algorithms, pointers and
objects at all.</li>
<li>I have only learned about what good programming practices are (OO,
functional, whatever) really means in the last two years, spending
almost every free minute of those many i had on projects to test
around with patterns and programming styles.</li>
<li>I went to my first conference last year september, the IPC in Mainz,
getting to know lots of great people in the community.</li>
<li>I don’t have a license at all (<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.libssh2.org/index.php?/archives/122-Seven-Things.html">Reference to
Sara</a>).
I am afraid of driving cars, although I drive my bike through the
biggest crossroads in town like nuts.</li>
<li>I am a timeline oriented reader, having made me masterplans to read
both all the Discworld and Ian Rankin novels in the correct order to
not miss a single reference.</li>

<p>Its sad that everyone I would want to tag was already tagged by someone
else, still for the head count:</p>

<p>I am in a dilemma. I have condemned the usage of Zend_Soap_Server (or
any other webservice server handler) <a class="reference external" href="http://www.whitewashing.de/blog/articles/106">inside a Model-View-Controller
application</a> before.
Still I get questions about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.whitewashing.de/blog/articles/65">my old Zend_Soap_Server and
Zend_Soap_AutoDiscover
example</a> not working in
the MVC scenario. The following example provides you with a working Soap
server inside a Zend_Controller_Action, although I discourage the use
of it and would suggest using a dedicated script outside the dispatching
process to gain multitudes of performance, which webservices often
require.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>require_once "/path/to/HelloWorldService.php";

class MyDiscouragedSoapServerController extends Zend_Controller_Action
{
    public function serverAction()
    {
        $server = new Zend_Soap_Server("http://example.com/pathto/wsdl");
        $server-&gt;setClass('HelloWorldService');
        $server-&gt;handle();
    }

    public function wsdlAction()
    {
        $wsdl = new Zend_Soap_AutoDiscover();
        $wsdl-&gt;setUri('http://example.com/pathto/server');
        $wsdl-&gt;setClass('HelloWorldService');
        $wsdl-&gt;handle();
    }
}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now all you have to do is create two routes, one that makes
<strong>http://example.com/pathto/server</strong> point to
<strong>MyDiscouragedSoapServerController::serverAction</strong> and the other route
that makes <strong>http://example.com/pathto/wsdl</strong> point to
<strong>MyDiscouragedSoapServerController::wsdlAction</strong>. The wrong version
(Version Mismatch) error comes from sending a request for the WSDL file
to the actual Soap Server, which he doesn’t like.</p>

            <h1><a href="2009/03/27/test-your-legacy-php-application-with-function-mocks.html">Test your Legacy PHP Application with Function Mocks!</a></h1>
<p>Much talking is going on about Unittesting, Mocks and TDD in the PHP
world. For the most this discussions surround object-oriented PHP code,
frameworks and applications.</p>
<p>Yet I would assert that the reality for PHP developers (me included) is
dealing with PHP 4, PHP 5 migrated, or non-object oriented legacy
applications which are near to impossible to bring under test. Still
this code works, is in production and needs maintenance and possibly
extension for new features.</p>
<p>For example many applications may still use <strong>mysql_*</strong> functions at
length inside their model or have multiple nested function levels
(Example: Wordpress). <a class="reference external" href="http://pecl.php.net/package/runkit">Runkit</a> to
the rescue: A PECL extension that can hack your running PHP code, such
that method or functions are repointed to execute new implementations.
Using this extension you can actually mock out internal PHP functions,
which is great to bring legacy code under test.</p>
<p>Consider this following proof of concept, <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/padraic/runkit/tree/master">using the Runkit extension
build by Padraic Brady</a>
(the one from pecl.php.net does not compile on PHP 5.2), which replaces
the functionality of <strong>mysql_query()</strong>. You have to set the following
option in your php.ini: <strong>runkit.internal_override = On</strong> for this to
work. By default only user-defined functions may be overwritten by
Runkit.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>class FunctionMocker
{
    protected $_mockedFuncBehaviourMap = array();

    public function mock($funcName, $return=null)
    {
        $newFuncCode = 'return "'.$return.'";';

        $renamedName = "__".$funcName."_mockOriginalCopy";
        runkit_function_copy($funcName, $renamedName);
        runkit_function_redefine($funcName, '', $newFuncCode);

        $this-&gt;_mockedFuncBehaviourMap[$funcName] = $renamedName;
    }

    public function reset()
    {
        foreach($this-&gt;_mockedFuncBehaviourMap AS $funcName =&gt; $renamedName) {
            runkit_function_remove($funcName);
            runkit_function_copy($renamedName, $funcName);
            runkit_function_remove($renamedName);
        }
        $this-&gt;_mockedFuncBehaviourMap = array();
    }
}

$mocker = new FunctionMocker();
$mocker-&gt;mock('mysql_query', 'hello world!');

echo mysql_query(); // hello world

$mocker-&gt;reset();

mysql_query(); // error
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This example, only allows for string return values of the mock and
has no support for replacing the arguments of the mocked function.
Also chaining of different return values based on input or call
number might be interesting. Some kind of Code Generator Tool would
have to be implemented to support this functionality. Additionally
Assertions and Verifying should be implemented for the function
arguments. All in all this would allow to mock functions as you
would mock interfaces/classes, which would be a great addition for
all those legacy applications that use procedural PHP.</p>
<p>Additionally what the real killer for runkit would be: The
possibility to insert PHP callbacks instead of real PHP code into
the <strong>runkit_function_redefine</strong>.</p>
