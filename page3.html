<h1><a href="2009/03/10/speaking-about-framework-quality-on-the-ipc-spring-09.html">Speaking about Framework Quality on the IPC Spring 09</a></h1>
<p>Just a short notice, my thesis is taking its last breath, I will be
speaking on the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.phpconference.com">IPC Spring 09
conference</a> in Berlin end of may this
year on Framework Quality and Unittests:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Framework Quality: Unit-Tests as silent witness</strong></dt>
<dd>Unit-Tests are often overlooked in framework discussions that focus</dd>
</dl>
<p>on features, performance, tools or database abstraction. However
they are a silent witness on how poor or well frameworks are
designed. In this presentation we will look at the testsuites of the
big players in the PHP framework business - Zend Framework,
ezComponents, Symfony and CakePHP - and reveal their hidden secrets.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This talk will make heavy use of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei/puma/tree">PHP Unittest and Metrics
Aggregator tool</a>, which i haven
written on several times. For both CakePHP and Symfony extensions for
their testtools may have to be written.</p>
<p>I am really excited for my first time being speaker on a conference and
looking forward to see you at IPC.</p>

<h1><a href="2009/10/05/php-codesniffer-for-netbeans-v0-2.html">PHP CodeSniffer for Netbeans v0.2</a></h1>
<p>I finally found some time to spend some time on the <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/beberlei/netbeans-php-enhancements/">PHP CodeSniffer for
Netbeans
plugin</a>.
Previously the plugin used an unnecessary API which restricted the use
to Netbeans 6.7.0 only. This API was removed so that the plugin should
now work with all Netbeans Versions &gt;= 6.7.0.</p>
<p>Additionally when working the previous version would scan every PHP
script on a file per file basis when the all projects or main projects
filters were activated. This rendered made the plugin almost useless. In
the current version scans of filters that contain more than one file are
blocked. That means you will only see Coding Violations when you enable
the “Current File” filter. Using any other filter will just do nothing
and won’t put your Netbeans in permanent hibernation mode (aka useless
mode).</p>
<p>There is also some preference <strong>“phpcs.codingStandard”</strong> using the
<strong>`NbPreferences
API &lt;http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util/org/openide/util/NbPreferences.html&gt;`_</strong>
which allows to configure the coding standard. [STRIKEOUT:However this
feature was contributed by <a class="reference external" href="http://manuel-pichler.de/">Manuel
Piechler</a> and I don’t yet understand how I
can manipulate it. Maybe someone knows how (*Looking in Mapis general
direction*)?] By default the Zend Coding Standard is used.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Coding Standard can be changed by hacking into the config
file .netbeans/6.7/config/Preferences.properties setting
“phpcs.CodingStandard=”. Additionally I fixed several bugs with the
inline highlighting that did not refresh when lines in the file changed.</p>

<h1><a href="2009/12/19/trying-a-two-step-pear-phar-approach-to-develop-and-deploy.html">Trying a Two Step PEAR/PHAR approach to develop and deploy</a></h1>
<p>With PHP 5.3 the PHAR extension is a pretty powerful concept for all
your deployment needs, however it does not tell the complete story.
Frameworks, Libraries and many different of them are used throughout
applications and in recent times people even began to chery-pick the
best components from each of the frameworks and package them together.
With Pirum being a simple PEAR channel server there is also momentum for
projects to distribute their code via PEAR.</p>
<p>However PEAR is mostly used in the server-wide configuration use-case,
which is not very useful if you plan to distribute your complete
application in one PHAR file. I just recently had the idea for this
scenario, so please bear with me and add all the feedback and comments
you can come up with. I tested this with the ongoing rewrite of my blog
software.</p>
<p>First we’ll add a new user that we develop our application with:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>sudo useradd -m -g www-data whitewashing
sudo passwd whitewashing
su - whitewashing</pre>
</div>
<p>Now there is the possibility that with this user PHP and PEAR is not in
your $PATH enviroment, so you might have to add it. In my case on Ubuntu
i also had to switch the console from /bin/sh to /bin/bash for this
user. Then we need to setup our application, I am going to use the Zend
Framework project style here but with a little twist. We will add a
distinction between vendor and project libraries by adding a <em>vendor</em>
directory into the main folder.</p>
<p>But first we create a folder for our application, and create a Zend
Framework project in the subfolder “trunk”, which will be the focus of
our development.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>whitewashing@desktop:~$ mkdir whitewashing
whitewashing@desktop:~$ zf create project whitewashing/trunk
Creating project at /home/whitewashing/whitewashing/trunk
whitewashing@desktop:~$ mkdir whitewashing/trunk/vendor</pre>
</div>
<p>Now we can configure an Apache virtual host to point to our
/home/whitewashing/whitewashing/public directory, i call this
“whitewashing-dev” add it to my /etc/hosts and can visit the dummy
project page.</p>
<p>We then configure our PEAR installation for the specific application
user and re-configure the bin and php library paths:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>whitewashing@desktop:~$ pear create-config /home/whitewashing/ .pearrc
whitewashing@desktop:~$ pear config-set php_dir /home/whitewashing/whitewashing/trunk/vendor
whitewashing@desktop:~$ pear config-set bin_dir /home/whitewashing/whitewashing/trunk/bin</pre>
</div>
<p>This configuration assumes that we will install all our stuff into our
development trunk. From there also the PEAR installed libraries might be
copied into branches or tags. PEAR Project tests, configuration and
web-files will still be put by default under $HOME/pear/*. We don’t
need them for our applications.</p>
<p>Now we install all the dependencies our project needs, in this case Zend
Framework, Doctrine 2, HTML Purifier:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>whitewashing@desktop:~$ pear channel-discover pear.zfcampus.org
whitewashing@desktop:~$ pear install zfcampus/zf-alpha
whitewashing@desktop:~$ pear channel-discover htmlpurifier.org
whitewashing@desktop:~$ pear install hp/HTMLPurifier
whitewashing@desktop:~$ pear channel-discover pear.phpdoctrine.org
whitewashing@desktop:~$ pear install pear.phpdoctrine.org/DoctrineORM-2.0.0</pre>
</div>
<p>Now we have all three of the packages installed in our project folder
<cite>whitewashing/trunk/vendor</cite>, see:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>whitewashing@desktop:~$ ls -aFl whitewashing/trunk/vendor/
total 680

</div>
<p>And both Doctrine and ZF registered their binary CLi tools inside the
<cite>whitewashing/trunk/bin/</cite> folder:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>whitewashing@desktop:~$ ls -aFl bin/
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 2 whitewashing www-data 4096 2009-12-13 14:45 ./
drwxr-xr-x 8 whitewashing www-data 4096 2009-12-13 14:36 ../
-rwxr-xr-x 1 whitewashing www-data   50 2009-12-13 14:45 doctrine*
-rwxr-xr-x 1 whitewashing www-data  169 2009-12-13 14:45 doctrine.php*
-rwxr-xr-x 1 whitewashing www-data 1511 2009-12-13 14:36 zf*</pre>
</div>
<p>We now have the full control over the versions of our dependencies, we
can call “pear upgrade ” whenever we want to update one of the ZF,
Doctrine or HtmlPurifier libraries inside our application.</p>
<p>Now some magic is gonna happen, we start to develop our application and
such which is all not really interesting for this topic. At some point
we want to package it all up into a PHAR file and distribute it. We want
to package our application in one big phar file. We also want to make
sure that the configuration files in
<cite>whitewashing/trunk/application/configs/</cite> are not distributed, but have
to be created on the server and are kept that way. We could write an
installer script for this configuration management.</p>
<p>The reference for PHAR files is the PHP Manual for the Basics and Cal
Evans’ two posts
(<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.calevans.com/2009/07/19/lessons-in-phar/">1</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.calevans.com/2009/07/26/packaging-zend-framework-as-a-phar-revisited/">2</a>)
on this topic, aswell as <a class="reference external" href="http://geekmonkey.org/articles/PHP_Archives">a post on
Geekmonkey</a>. Contrary to
most other PHP extensions, PHAR has an extensive documentation, however
its not organized terribly well. Also there are no real use-cases and
scenarios discussed, methods are only looked at in isolation. Cals posts
are very good on understanding how to package up different libraries,
but there is no word on distributing web applications. That is where the
Geekmonkey post comes in to wire it all together.</p>
<p>For a Zend Framework application that should have both a web and a cli
(cronjobs) entry point into the application we need a specific stub file
for the PHAR bootstrapping. A stub is a little PHP script that is
executed whenever your PHAR file is included into your php script. It is
essentially a front-controller for your PHAR application. It also has
mount capabilities that allow to import files or directories from
outside into the PHAR context. This is a powerful feature that is
required to distribute configurable applications like our blog.</p>
<p>This screenshot shows how the application is currently structued in
development mode. In production its structure should look like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>whitewashing
|--application
|  |--configs
|     |-- my application config files are all here...
|--bin
|  |--whitewashing.php
|--public
|  |--index.php
|  |--.htaccess
|--whitewashing.phar</pre>
</div>
<p>The whitewashing.php and index.php files are the application entry
points that only include the phar file and trigger the application
bootstrapping that will be included in the Stub file. They both look
like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>&lt;?php
define('EXTERNAL_APPLICATION_ROOT', __DIR__.&quot;/../&quot;);
include EXTERNAL_APPLICATION_ROOT.&quot;/whitewashing.phar&quot;;</pre>
</div>
<p>Including a PHAR file essentially has two conesequences:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The PHAR path will be added to your include path.</li>
<li>The stub file will be executed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our application stub looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>&lt;?php

if(defined('EXTERNAL_APPLICATION_ROOT')) {
    // Mount the external application/configs directory as config if it exists.
    if (file_exists(EXTERNAL_APPLICATION_ROOT.&quot;/application/configs&quot;)) {
        Phar::mount(&quot;application/configs&quot;, EXTERNAL_APPLICATION_ROOT.&quot;/application/configs&quot;);
    }
}

/** Zend_Loader_Autoloader */
require_once 'Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php';
$autoloader = Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance();

if (php_sapi_name() == &quot;cli&quot;) {
    require_once 'bin/whitewashing.php';
} else {
    require_once 'public/index.php';
}

__HALT_COMPILER();</pre>
</div>
<p>The first bit of the stub mounts the external application configs
directory into the stub and hides possible directories that are present
at this location in the PHAR file. This allows us to distribute our
application with a default configuration, but allows any user to replace
the configuration files to fit the application to his need.</p>
<p>The second bit loads Zend Framework Autoloader that is required by the
bootstrapping mechanism. The third bit decides wheater this request is
executed from the CLI- or the Web-Entry point of the application. The
fourth bit, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__HALT_COMPILER();</span></tt> is a technically required call inside
your stub-file.</p>
<p>Now that we have a stub-file for our application, we can package it and
distribute it. I am using a modified version of Cal Evans example for
this. I have extracted his directory traversal to find all the relevant
into a re-usable FilterIterator implementation. I <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/3b20264b857dbdabf526">pasted my package.php
a Gist</a> on Github. Now
this should probably be put into the build context of your application,
possibly as a phing or ant task or something alike.</p>
<p>Now what this build process does not manage is the creation of the
application entry point php and .htaccess files, but since they won’t
ever change its easy to add them to the build directory for now. An even
more sophisiticated version of the build script would lead to the
creation of an additional tar.gz of the complete application folder. Our
deployment process would then be as easy as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the application is not installed yet, unpack the tarball into its
location.</li>
<li>If the application should be updated, just replace the PHAR file.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need the ability to go back to any version of your application
you could make use of symlinks.</p>

<h1><a href="2009/07/30/php-codesniffer-support-for-netbeans.html">PHP CodeSniffer Support for Netbeans</a></h1>
<p>I dived into the code of my new favorite IDE
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.netbeans.org">Netbeans</a> these last days and came up with
an <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/beberlei/netbeans-php-enhancements/tree/master">extension
module</a>,
which adds PHP CodeSniffer Support on a per file basis to make my life
much easier. It shows warnings and errors as annotations to the Editor
and marks the affected lines in yellow and red.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/beberlei/netbeans-php-enhancements/netbeans_cs_support.png">|image0|</a></p>
<p>[STRIKEOUT:My Java skills being very bad, it will only work on Linux
currently, since the PHP Code Sniffer “binary” is hardcoded into the
Java Source code. You have to create a “/usr/bin/phpcs2” executable,
which is a wrapper that looks like:]</p>
<p>With Manuals extensions (see the comments) the module now works without
the wrapper script. It might even work under Windows now. Yet now the
Zend Coding standard is enforced though. I am working on making that one
configurable next.</p>
<p>You can install the <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/beberlei/netbeans-php-enhancements/downloads">NBM module install
file</a>
from the GitHub repository into Netbeans and it “should” work then.</p>
<p>I hope to get more familiar with Netbeans in the future to add some more
PHP tools and enhance Code Sniffer support.</p>

<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>$container = new sfServiceContainerBuilder();

$loader = new sfServiceContainerLoaderFileXml($container);
$loader-&gt;load(APPLICATION_PATH.'/config/objects.xml');

$application = new Zend_Application(
    APPLICATION_ENV,
    APPLICATION_PATH . '/config/application.xml'
);
$application-&gt;getBootstrap()-&gt;setContainer($container);
$application-&gt;bootstrap()
            -&gt;run();</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Resources instantiated by Zend_Application are then injected into the
container by the name of the resource and are given the resource
instance. Any object from the Symfony container can then use these
dependencies in their object setup. The only drawback of the integration
is the fact that the Symfony Container is case-sensitive in regards to
the service names but Zend_Application lower-cases all service before
injecting them into the container. The following code is a restatement
of my previous example of a <strong>MyModel</strong> class which requires a
<strong>Zend_Db</strong> and <strong>Zend_Cache</strong> constructor argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>$container-&gt;register('myModel', 'MyModel')
          -&gt;addArgument(new sfServiceReference('db'))
          -&gt;addArgument(new sfServiceReference('cache'));</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Access to a MyModel instance with its dependencies is then granted
through the call <strong>$container-&gt;myModel</strong> throughout the application.
Make sure to call this after running Zend_Application::bootstrap, so
that the Resource dependencies are injected first.</p>

<h1><a href="2008/02/12/pdt-back-to-easyeclipse-with-php-extension.html">PDT: Back to easyeclipse with PHP extension</a></h1>
<p>I am disappointed by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eclipse.org/pdt/">PDT</a> for Eclipse.
The current version strikes my rather old machine with “just” 512mb to
death. Building projects is not possible even when assigning eclipse all
my available memory, because of an Java Heap Error (<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.wolff-hamburg.de/archives/20-Migrating-to-PDT.html">See this blog
post</a>).
This effectivly hinders you to use all the completion and hint features,
because PDT does not know about any functions, classes and their phpdoc
descriptions.</p>
<p>PDT is also missing some very important features. Marking all occurances
of a function, class, constant or variable on click for example. PHP
Errors and Warnings are display in a way so that you won’t find them and
if you do, you won’t understand what they mean.</p>
<p>So I am going back to my easyeclipse with php combination, which always
worked well, the only problem being that it is no longer under active
development. At least it has all the features I need for now.</p>

<h1><a href="2008/05/25/introducing-zend-controller-scaffolding.html">Introducing: Zend Controller Scaffolding</a></h1>
<p>In the last couple of weeks I <a class="reference external" href="http://codecaine.co.za/posts/form-generation-with-zend-form-part-2/">came across the
idea</a>
of building a little component for scaffolding in Zend Framework. After
playing around with this idea a little I came up with an
Zend_Controller_Scaffolding object, which extends the
Zend_Controller_Action object.</p>
<p>It takes any Zend_Db_Table_Abstract object and generates create and
update forms using Zend_Form and displays them in the Controller. The
component is very easy to use, as this example shows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>class SomeController extends WW_Controller_Scaffolding {
    public function init() {
        $this-&gt;setScaffolding(new ZendDbTableModel(), $options);
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You now have access to the following actions of the controller:
some/create some/edit some/delete and some/index (some/list). They
handle all your model editing dreams.</p>
<p>All you have to own is the WW_Controller_Scaffolding Library Class and
a folder of scaffolding view templates both of which are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.beberlei.de/sources/zend_controller_scaffolding-0.5.5.tar.gz">bundled in an
archive you can
download</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Download</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.beberlei.de/sources/zend_controller_scaffolding-0.5.5.tar.gz">Download Version
0.5.5</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>0.5.5: Put Component into own Namespace (WW = Whitewashing). Make it
possible to hide fields in the list via the options. Allow to specify
scaffolding view scripts folder via options.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Install &amp; Usage</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>Untar the two folders include/ and views/ into your
Zend Framework project application directory.

Make sure the include folder is in your Zend_Loader
include path or move the Scaffolding.php so that it
is placed in your library include path.

Define each Controller that should be a Scaffolding Interface
as:

class SomeController extends WW_Controller_Scaffolding {
    public function init() {
        $this-&gt;setScaffolding(new ZendDbTableModel(), $options);
    }
}

Where $options is an array or Zend_Config object with any of the following keys:

  'allow_edit_primary_key' True/false - Wheater the form allows you to set the
                          Primary Key fields or not

 'field_names' an Array of the Database Tables field names mapped to Label Names

 'hide_list_fields' Array of database table field names that should not be displayed in the list overview.

 'checkbox' an Array of Database Table field names that should be represented
            as Checkbox. Useful for TINYINT(1) fields that represent boolean decisions.

 'view_folder' Sometimes you want to use different views for scaffolding in one project. Use
               this variable and copy the scaffolding folder for each component you want to
               change the view basics for.</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Todos &amp; Problems:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Many To Many Relationsships are not implemented yet (Using
MultiSelec).</li>
<li>Compound Keys are probably not working correctly</li>
<li>Relationsships on non-primary key fields probably don’t work as
expected</li>
<li>Relationsships with lots of data are not scaled down for easy
administration.</li>

<h1><a href="2008/05/18/my-2-cents-on-zend-search-lucene-update-problems.html">My 2 cents on Zend_Search_Lucene Update Problems</a></h1>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend_Search_Lucene</a> (or Lucene in
general) does not support an update statement, therefore we must check
via find() if a specific article that should be updated already exists.</p>
<p>Numerous solutions exist for this problem (<a class="reference external" href="http://devzone.zend.com/content/zendcon_07_slides/Evron_Shahar_Indexing_With_Zend_Search_Lucene-ZendCon07.pdf">for example this PDF
Tutorial by a Zend
Programmer</a>).
Mine looks as follows. The first thing is to Set an Analyzer other from
the default one. The Default Analyzer only looks at letters, not at
numbers.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer::setDefault(new
    Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer_Common_Utf8Num_CaseInsensitive()
);
$index = Zend_Search_Lucene::open('/path/to/index/directory');</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We can now save an identifier containing letters and numbers, for
example the md5 string of the Article Database ID.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>$doc = new Zend_Search_Lucene_Document();
$field = Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::Keyword('id', md5($data['id']));
$doc-&gt;addField($field);
$index-&gt;addDocument($doc);</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Before updating an entry you have to delete any entry that has been
indexed before:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>$hits = $index-&gt;find('id:'.md5($articleID));
foreach($hits AS $hit) {
    $index-&gt;delete($hit-&gt;id);
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>

Lucene</a>
(given abote) uses an extended version of this delete routine snippet
that also checks if an article is up to date and does not have to be
reindexed and deletes multiple entries of one article.</p>

<h1><a href="2008/05/17/integrated-zend-layout-into-this-blog.html">Integrated Zend_Layout into this blog</a></h1>
<p>I finished with integrating Zend_Layout into this blog software today.
At first I thought it is quite hard to use especially if you want to
integrate dynamic navigational contents depending on the current
module/controller/action setup. But I came up with a combination of
actionStack and Named Response Sections as <a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.layout.quickstart.html#zend.layout.quickstart.mvc">described in the ZF
Documentation of the Layout
component</a>,
which is quite easy to understand, use and extend.</p>
<p>At each of the major Controllers I put different actions from a specific
Navigation Controller on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.actionhelpers.html#zend.controller.actionhelpers.actionstack">ActionStack</a>
(mostly global per Controller using the init() class method).</p>
<p>A typical controller looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>class BlogController extends Zend_Controller_Action
{
    public function init()
    {
        $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;actionStack('tagcloud', 'Navigation');
        $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;actionStack('userinfo', 'Navigation');
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The NavigationController looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>class NavigationController extends Zend_Controller_Action
{
    public function tagcloudAction()
    {
        // Do not render the content of this action to the default output.
        $this-&gt;getHelper(&quot;ViewRenderer&quot;)-&gt;setNoRender();

        [...]

        // Append content to secondaryNavigation named response section
        $this-&gt;getResponse()-&gt;append('secondaryNavigation', $this-&gt;view-&gt;render('navigation/tagcloud.phtml'));
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The layout.pthml then just calls certain named sections, for example &lt;=?
$this-&gt;layout()-&gt;secondaryNavigation; ?&gt;</p>

<h1><a href="2008/05/17/using-zend-http-client-to-ping-technorati.html">Using Zend_Http_Client to Ping Technorati</a></h1>
<p>Send a ping to Technorati manually is a pain in the ass. Writing a
little Method that handles this functionality for your own blog software
is quite easy. Call the following method after you created or updated a
post of yours:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>private function _pingTechnorati()
{
    $xml = $this-&gt;view-&gt;render('ping_technorati.phtml');

    $httpclient = new Zend_Http_Client('http://rpc.technorati.com/rpc/ping');
            $httpclient-&gt;setHeaders('User-Agent', 'PHP/Zend Framework/Zend_Http');

    $httpclient-&gt;setRawData($xml, 'text/xml')-&gt;request('POST');

    $response = $httpclient-&gt;request();

    if($response-&gt;isSuccessful() === true) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You also need a little view in XML format like it is described in the
<a class="reference external" href="http://technorati.com/developers/ping/">Technorati Ping Configuration
Guide</a> and ready to go you
are!</p>
