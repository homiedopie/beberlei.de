<p>The Slack Ubuntu/Linux application doesn’t provide a way to disable the tray
icon and that means the unread or highlight notification bubbles will distract
you whenever somebody writes something in ANY channel that you are in, even
when the messages are not even interesting for you.</p>
<p>I wrote to Slack support to make a feature request and they suggested to make
clever use of an upstream Electron bug that makes the tray icon disappear in
17.04 as a workaround. This gave me the idea for a  more stable workaround.</p>
<p>I poked around in the list of files of the <cite>slack-desktop</cite> package and found
out that you can just exchange the files for the tray icons , so that the Slack
app is fooled into thinking it is showing the unread or highlight icons.</p>

<p>From the Google results it is not very easy to find out what this means.</p>
<p>Technically the extension was compiled with a PHP version using the
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-enable-debug</span></span> flag, which wraps all calls to <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">zval_ptr_dtor</span></span> in a wrapper
macro that does not exist in a regular, non-debug build.</p>
<p>But a debug extension and non-debug PHP are incompatible.</p>
<p>PHP extensions are only compatible between different installations if the
following constraints are the same for the compiling and the executing PHP
binary:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>OS (Linux, Mac)</li>
<li>libc (glibc or musl for Alpine)</li>
<li>PHP version up to the minor level (5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1)</li>
<li>extension version (20151012 for PHP 7.0)</li>
<li>thread-safety (ZTS) or non-thread-safety (NTS)</li>
<li>debug or non-debug (<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--enable-debug</span></span> flag during compile).</li>

<p>Almost four years ago I wrote about <a class="reference external" href="https://beberlei.de/2013/04/06/a_failed_side_project.html">Lessons learned: A failed side project</a> and when I stumbled
across the post <a class="reference external" href="http://ewanvalentine.io/how-to-never-complete-anything/">How to *never* complete anything</a> several days ago I
felt it was time for an update. Ewan’s post covers similar lessons learned that I
wrote about in my post and I heard about many side projects that failed
because of similar mistakes.</p>
<p>There was an argument on HackerNews what a side project is, so I want to
clarify this up front. I am talking about side-projects written with some intend
of turning them into a business, as opposed to side-projects that are started for
learning new technical skills.</p>
<p>Three years ago I have started working on a PHP profiling and monitoring
side-project, which I turned into a business called <a class="reference external" href="https://tideways.io">Tideways</a>. In this post I wanted to share some of the reasons why
I think this project was successful.</p>
<p>The idea for “XHProf as a Service” was on my “Side Project Ideas” trello board,
where I write everything down that I want to try or experiment with. I have
picked it out for implementation as my new side project, because that month I
would have needed this for a large scale load-testing project at my job with
<a class="reference external" href="https://qafoo.com">Qafoo</a>. It was not the first time I needed this for
myself, I felt a regular pain that a product like this didn’t exist.</p>
<p>Not wanting to make the same mistakes, I have applied all the lessons learned from 2013:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>I picked a small scope</strong>: The first version contained very few features, re-used
the existing xhprof PHP extension (Tideways now has its own) and instead of a
daemon collecting data in realtime used a cronjob to collect data from a
directory every minute. After six months of development I removed half of
the features I experimented with to reduce the scope again.</li>
<li><strong>I did not compete with the established competition on features</strong>, instead I focussed
on two single features that I thought where the most important: Response time
monitoring and Callgraph profiling. By focussing on a niche (PHP intead of all
languages) I was able to provide a better solution than existing generic tools (obviously biased).</li>
<li><strong>I did not work all alone on the project</strong>, instead I have immediately enlisted
alpha-users that gave valuable feedback after 1 month of work and some of
them are still our most active customers; brought in my employer Qafoo who is
now a shareholder in the new business; formed business partnerships with
companies that are now our biggest customers and re-sellers.</li>
<li><strong>I did not keep the idea secret</strong>, when I announced our beta program
publically in June 2014 the launch newsletter list received 250 sign ups and 60
Twitter followers in a few hours.</li>
<li><strong>I choose boring technology</strong>, using a monolithic Symfony, PHP, MySQL
backend and jQuery frontend stack allowed me to iterate very fast on new
features with technology that I already mastered. I <a class="reference external" href="http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">spent three innovation
tokens</a> on using Golang for
the daemon, using Elasticsearch as TimeSeries database and later on learning
C for the PHP extension.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making these decisions has not magically turned my side project into a
profit-generating business. However I have avoided all the problems that I have
written about in my failed side project lessons post from four years ago.</p>
<p>The fast iterations on a small scope combined with early user feedback showed
that this idea will work as a business and it was worthwhile to keep pushing
for two years, until the project generated enough revenue after all other costs
to pay my full time salary.</p>
<p>This felt like passing level 1 in getting a bootstrapped side project of the
ground (there are many more levels after that).</p>

            <h1><a href="2017/03/12/explicit_global_state_with_context_objects.html">Explicit Global State with Context Objects</a></h1>
<p>Global State is considered bad for maintainability of software. Side effects on
global state can cause a very nasty class of bugs. Context objects are one
flavour of global state. For example, I remember that Symfony1 had a
particularly nasty context object that was a global singleton containing
references to very many services of the framework.</p>
<p>As with every concept in programming, there are no absolute truths though and
there are many use-cases where context objects make sense. This blog posts
tries to explain my reasons for using context objects.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-context">
<h2>What is a Context?</h2>
<p>Context is defined as all the information and circumstances in which
something can be <em>fully</em> understood. In daily programming this is mostly
related to the state of variables and databases. Some examples in the world
of PHP include the superglobals <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$_GET</span></span> and <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$_POST</span></span>.</p>
<p>Any piece of code is always running in some context and the question is how much
of it is explicit in the code and how much is hidden.</p>
<p>A context object is a way to make the existing context explicit for your code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="context-objects">
<h2>Context Objects</h2>
<p>Lets take a look at the Definition of a context object</p>
<blockquote>
<div>A context object encapsulates the references/pointers to services and
configuration information used/needed by other objects. It allows the objects
living within a context to see the outside world. Objects living in a different
context see a different view of the outside world.</div></blockquote>
<p>Besides the obvious use of encapsulating services and config variables, this
definition mentions two important properties:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Allows to see the outside world, which does <em>not</em> mean it can change it.
In my opinion it is essential that context objects are immutable,
to avoid side effects.</li>
<li>The possibility of objects living in different contexts, seeing
different context objects suggets that a context object
should never be a singleton.</li>
</ol>
<p>By using objects instead of global variables for context, we can use
encapsulation to achieve immutability.</p>
<p>Context already exists in PHP through the existance of superglobals. Frameworks
usually wrap them to achieve the properties mentioned above: Immutability and
Not-Singleton.</p>
<p>The Symfony Request object is one good example, where these properties (almost)
hold. Wrapping the superglobals with this object even allowed creating
Subrequests inside PHP requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="application-context">
<h2>Application Context</h2>
<p>Now that we have defined context we should make use of context objects in your
applications.</p>
<p>Anything that is an important global information in your application is
relevant for the context:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Building a wiki? I actually have the idea for this approach from
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.fitnesse.org/">Fitnesse</a>, a testing tool based on the wiki idea maintained by Uncle Bob
and his team. Their <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/unclebob/fitnesse/blob/master/src/fitnesse/FitNesseContext.java">context object</a> provides access to the current and the
root page nodes.</li>
<li>Building a shop? The users basket id, selected language/locale, current
campaign (newsletter, google, social media?) can be information that should
be available all the time.</li>
<li>Building an analytics software? The currently selected date/time-range is
probably important for all queries.</li>
<li>Building a CMS/blog? The current page/post-id, the root page id, user
language/locale seem to be good candidates for an application context.
Wordpress does this although their context is global and encapsulated in an
object.</li>
<li>Building a multi-tenant app? The tenant-id and configuration for this
tentant (selected product plan, activated features, ...) are
good candidates for the context.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="real-world-example-context-in-tideways">
<h2>Real World Example: Context in Tideways</h2>
<p>How to introduce such a context? We could create an object in our application,
for example how we did it in <a class="reference external" href="https://tideways.io">Tideways</a>
with selected tenant (organization), application, date-range and server environment:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">PageContext</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="sd">/**</span>
<span class="sd">     * @var \Xhprof\Bundle\OrganizationBundle\Entity\Organization</span>
<span class="sd">     */</span>
    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="nv">$organization</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="sd">/**</span>
<span class="sd">     * @var \Xhprof\Bundle\OrganizationBundle\Entity\Application</span>
<span class="sd">     */</span>
    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="nv">$application</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="sd">/**</span>
<span class="sd">     * @var \Xhprof\Common\Date\DateRange</span>
<span class="sd">     */</span>
    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="nv">$selectedDateRange</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="sd">/**</span>
<span class="sd">     * @var \Xhprof\Bundle\ProfilerBundle\View\EnvironmentView</span>
<span class="sd">     */</span>
    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="nv">$selectedEnvironment</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="c1">// constructor and getters</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This object is created during request boot, in my case with a framework
listener. The listener checks for access rights and security constraints,
showing the 403/access denied page when necessary. This make 90% of access
control checks unneeded that are usually cluttering the controller.</p>
<p>The context is then made available for the application by using a Symfony
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.beberlei.de/2013/02/19/extending_symfony2__paramconverter.html">parameter converter</a>, every controller-action can get access to the context
by type-hinting for it:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ApplicationController</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">showAction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">PageContext</span> <span class="nv">$pageContext</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">array</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'application'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$pageContext</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">getApplication</span><span class="p">());</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The beauty of this approach is avoiding global state and passing
the context around in a non-singleton way. Depending on the framework
you use, it might be hard to achieve this kind of context injection.</p>
<p>Now when I build <a class="reference external" href="https://www.beberlei.de/2014/10/14/lightweight_symfony2_controllers.html">lightweight Symfony2 controllers</a>
in my applications, using a context object allows me to use even less services
and move repetitive find and access control code outside of the controllers.</p>
<p>I have also written a Twig extension that gives me access to the context
object, so I don’t have to return it from every controller and created
a wrapper for the URL Generation that appends context information
to every URL (current date range + environment):</p>
<div class="highlight-jinja2"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>&lt;h1&gt;{{ pageContext.application.name }}&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;a href="{{ page_path("some_route") }}"&gt;Link with Context query arguments&lt;/a&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A context object can help you make global state explicit and control access to
it. Good requirements for a context object are immutability and not being a
singleton.</p>
<p>When used correctly this pattern can save you alot of redundant code and
simplify both controllers and views massively.</p>
<p>The pattern has its drawbacks: You have to be careful not put too powerful
objects into the context and if you can modify the context, then you will
probably introduce nasty side effets at some point. Additionally if you don’t
make sure that creating the context is a very fast operation then you will
suffer from performance hits, because the context is created on every request,

            <h1><a href="2016/05/28/composer_monorepo_plugin_previously_called_fiddler.html">Composer Monorepo Plugin (previously called Fiddler)</a></h1>
<p>I have <a class="reference external" href="http://www.whitewashing.de/2015/04/11/monolithic_repositories_with_php_and_composer.html">written about monorepos</a>
in this blog before, <a class="reference external" href="https://qafoo.com/resources/presentations/symfony_live_berlin_2015/monorepos.html">presented a talk</a>
about this topic and released a standalone tool called “Fiddler” that helps
integrating Composer with a monolithic repository.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, somebody in <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#composer-dev</span></span> IRC channel on
Freenode pointed me in the direction of Composer plugins to use with Fiddler
and it was an easy change to do so.</p>
<p>With the help of a new Composer v1.1 feature to add custom commands from a
plugin, Fiddler is now “gone” and I renamed the repository to the practical
<strong>beberlei/composer-monorepo-plugin</strong> package name on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei/composer-monorepo-plugin">Github</a>. After you install
this plugin, you have the possibility to maintain subpackages and their
dependencies in a single repository.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>$ composer require beberlei/composer-monorepo-plugin
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To use the plugin add <strong>monorepo.json</strong> files into each directory of a
subpackage and use a format similar to the <strong>composer.json</strong> to add
dependencies to a.) external composer packages that you have listed in your
global Composer file b.) other subpackages in the current monorepo.
See this example for a demonstration:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">"deps"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="s2">"vendor/symfony/http-foundation"</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s2">"components/Foo"</span>
    <span class="p">],</span>
    <span class="s2">"autoload"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s2">"psr-0"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">"Bar"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"src/"</span><span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This subpackage here defined in a hypothetical file
<strong>components/Bar/monorepo.json</strong> has dependencies to Symfony HTTP foundation
and another subpackage Foo with its own <strong>components/Foo/monnorepo.json</strong>.
Notice how we don’t need to specify versions (they are implicit) and import
other dependencies using the relative path from the global composer.json.</p>
<p>The monorepo plugin is integrated with Composer, so every time you perform install,
update or dump-autoload commands, the subpackages will be updated as well and
each get their own autoloader that can be included from <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vendor/autoload.php</span></span>
relative to the subpackages root directory as usual.</p>
