</ul>
<p>The last pattern for desigining your business logic is called
“Command-Query-Responsiblity-Seggregation” or short CQRS. It has its roots in
the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-query_separation">“Command Query Seperation”</a> principle that was
put forward by Bertrand Meyer.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a very good summary about what this principle is about:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Command-Query-Seperation states that every method should either be a
command that performs an action, or a query that returns data to the
caller, but not both. In other words, asking a question should not change
the answer. More formally, methods should return a value only if they are
referentially transparent and hence possess no side effects.</pre>
</div>
<p>CQRS is an OOP architecture design pattern building on that imperative
principle.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">There are many different variations of the CQRS pattern that
all have their place. This post describes a simple variant that does
<strong>not</strong>
use Messaging, DomainEvent or EventSourcing patterns, which are commonly mentioned
with CQRS.</p>
</div>
<p>At its heart is the seperation of Read and Write methods. This can be easily
achieved by just having two different service layer classes instead of one.
This insight alone is not really helpful, its just moving methods around.
Coupled to this change however is the notion, that read and write models don’t
necessarily have to be the same:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Getter/Setters: We don’t need setters in the write model, instead we use
explicit methods for each write operation. Entities are also much simpler
without bi-direcitional relationships that read/write models often need.
Read-only models (ViewModel) don’t need getters/setters. They could just use
public properties or even be arrays.</li>
<li>ORM Performance, Lazy Loading and Query Restrictions: In a write scenario we
mostly need queries by primary key, changing only some objects. In
read scenarios we need complex queries, joins and aggregations. A seperation
prevents both from affecting each other negatively.</li>
<li>Mapping Data-Transfer objects becomes simple. Instead of sending the whole
model back and forth, for the write scenario you define use-case specific
tasks and upates. This is much simpler than generic mapping of Data Transfer
objects to complex object graphs.</li>
<li>Transformating SQL directly to a view model in a highly optimized way.
Simple concept, but it has huge implications: A pure read-only model is simple to
maintain and refactor for any performance requirements that come up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore with CQRS our write service methods are not allowed to return data
anymore (With the exceptions to the rule of course). This may increase the
complexity at first, but it has benefits for scalability and decoupling.
Following this principle allows us to turn every command from synchroneous to
asynchroneous processing later without much problems. Services are allowed to
throw exceptions and refuse the execution. Proper validation of input data
should happen before executing write operations though.</p>
<p>One drawback of CQRS: A naive implementation doubles the amount of classes and
services to write. But there are simple shortcuts to avoid having to write a
full blown read-model if you don’t apply CQRS religiously:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Don’t use different data-stores for both models.</li>
<li>Mapping SQL to PHP arrays and stdClass objects through a simple gateway is
very simple. You can easily generialize this to a simple object that gives
efficent access to all your data.</li>
<li>Share parts of the write and read models if you don’t have to compromise
much.</li>
</ul>
<p>The important thing to take away from this seperation is, that the read part of
your application is seldom the part where business value lies in. Moving this
code into a different part of your applications allows you to work with the
underyling data-source much more directly, without need for much abstractions.</p>
<p>One thing that CQRS puts forward is the concept of Commands, Command Handlers
and Command Bus and how they interact. Commands are simple objects that
contain all the data necessary to execute an operation. Each command is
processed by exactly one command handler. The Command Bus is responsible to
route a command to its apporpriate command handler.</p>
<div class="section" id="example">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Here is the most simple implementation of the Command Bus, just holds a hash map
mapping command class names to command handlers:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">interface</span> <span class="nx">Handler</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">handle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$command</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">CommandBus</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="nv">$handlers</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">register</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$commandClassName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">Handler</span> <span class="nv">$handler</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">handlers</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">$commandClassName</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$handler</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">handle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$command</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">handlers</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">get_class</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$command</span><span class="p">)]</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">handle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$command</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In your code you would always pass Commands to the bus. That way the command
bus is a central entry point to any write operation. With this we can rewrite the
TransferMoney service:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TransferMoneyCommand</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nv">$sourceId</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nv">$destinationId</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nv">$money</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MoneyTransfer</span> <span class="k">implements</span> <span class="nx">Handler</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="nv">$accountDao</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// ctor omitted</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">handle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$command</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$source</span>      <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">accountDao</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$command</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">sourceId</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="nv">$destination</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">accountDao</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$command</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">destinationId</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="nv">$money</span>       <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Money</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$command</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">amount</span><span class="p">);</span>

        <span class="nv">$source</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">withdraw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$money</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="nv">$destination</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">deposit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$money</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There is also a benefit from the mental model of commands compared to the
“generic” term of model requests in EBI. Your write model gets task
oriented.</p>
<p>Routing everything through the command bus has several benefits as well:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Nesting handlers that take care of transactions, logging, 2 phase commits</li>
<li>Order nested command calls sequentially instead of deep into each other.</li>
<li>Asynchroneous processing with message queue become an option</li>
</ul>
<p>The command bus acts as the application boundary as described in the
Entity-Boundary-Interactor pattern, usage is simple:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MoneyController</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">transferAction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Request</span> <span class="nv">$request</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$commandBus</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">container</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'command_bus'</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="nv">$commandBus</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">handle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">TransferMoneyCommand</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="nv">$request</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">request</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'sourceId'</span><span class="p">),</span>

        <span class="p">));</span>

<div class="section" id="pros-and-cons">
<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>I really like CQRS for multiple reasons. It offers excplicit guidance how solve
tasks by making use of a range of different design patterns. This is very
helpful, because the code-base is based on conventions that are simple to
understand by everyone on the team. This structure liberates you from the curse
of choice and gives you a cookbook of best-practicies how to solve problems.
You want this struture for all your applications, regardless of what
architectural patttern you have chosen.</p>
<p>Embracing the difference between read and write models is another plus of CQRS.
It is very helpful, not to try fitting both read and write into one model.  You
also don’t run into so many read-related problems with an ORM any more. You
design the entities to be optimized for the write model only, loose the
bidirectional associations and avoid all the optmizations here and there for
read performance.</p>
<p>Compared to EBI, where we had to maintain a mapping between DTOs and entities,
CQRS explicitly uses the command based approach to avoid the complexity of
these mappings. You will still have to map between command and entity, however
doing so in the context of a use-case simplifies the code considerably compared
to a generic mapping solution.</p>
<p>One negative point: Its difficult to work with commands not returning any data
in some cases. You need to find simple ways to return messages to the
user. For that you also need to validate commands on the “client” or
controller side, using the read model, so that you can prevent invalid/illegal
commands from being sent as often as possible.</p>
<p>Without return values from your models, you are left to using mocks as means of
testing. This might be more difficult for developers to use and understand.
This problem goes away however, if you combine CQRS with Event Sourcing. A
topic that I will discuss in the next blog post.</p>

</ul>
<p>The next design pattern for technical system design is called “Data, Context,
Interaction”. It’s inventors Trygve Reenskaug and James Coplien call it a new
paradigm, in the context of PHPs langugage constraints it can be classified as
architectural design pattern. I came accross this pattern through <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/go_oh">Gordon Oheim</a>. He has also invested quite some time going
through the book on DCI and trying to understand this pattern with me.</p>
<p>As in the EBI pattern, DCI seperates data objects (Data) from behavior implemented
in use-cases (Context). Data objects are never directly involved in these
use-cases, but are “casted” to their respective roles that they are taking in
the use-case. This can be implemented with aggregation or traits in PHP.</p>
<p>One goal of DCI is to get object-oriented programming to a place, where you
can look at a use-case and its roles and be very sure that the programm is
running correctly, because you can guarantee that there are no unexpected side
effects. It also aims at keeping the amound of code required to keep in mind
for a given use-case as small as possible, allowing developers to reason about
the code with more confidence.</p>
<div class="section" id="terminology">
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>In DCI, <strong>data</strong> are objects that encapsulate the state of the application.
As in EBI, they only contain logic that is true for all the possible use-cases.
These classes represent <em>what the system is</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Roles</strong> and <strong>Context</strong> represent <em>what the system does</em> and are supposed to
capture the End User’s Mental Model as close as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Roles</strong> add behavior to the data objects by either wrapping them or
acting as traits for the data objects.</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong> is the use-case and fulfils its role by making roles <strong>interact</strong> with
each other. These roles then modify the underlying data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Starting from the bank account example of the EBI post, we can introduce DCI
quite easily by adding the missing concept of roles. In the use case of
transfering money that would be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>TransferMoneySource</li>
<li>TransferMoneySink (Destination)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do this by either introducing two interfaces and two concrete
implementations that accept the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">BankAccount</span></tt> as object to work on
or by building two traits. I will go down the route with traits, to show
one possible use-case for this new PHP 5.4 feature. The idea here is to
implement all the behavior necessary on a trait and then have simple dummy
objects using them in the tests for this use-case.</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Any checks for balances, credit limits or other things would also happen
here. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">withdraw</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">deposit</span></tt>  on the data objects should be as
dumb as possible, so that their implementation does not cause any side-effects
on the execution of this use-case.</p>
<p>The bank account would then be modified to look:</p>

<p>The use-case <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TransferMoney</span></tt> would then be modified to create Roles instead
of Data objects from the DAO. This can be a bit tricky when you have multiple
data objects implementing the same role and you have no way of knowing which
underyling data object to pick. The binding of data objects to roles happens
in the use-case. The use-case needs a means to retrieve objects with certain
roles, which then access underlying data sources. To avoid that your use-cases
have to know about how to bind roles to data, you could use GUIDs in your
application and fetch all objects from one data store. Another way would be to
implement data access objects for roles, that then know how to retrieve their
corresponding data.</p>

<p>The simplicity of this is appealing, however don’t forget that we have
abstracted I/O completley here. There has to be code that deals with that part
of the system somewhere. However this again is not at the heart of all the DCI
examples out there, making it difficult to reason about the actual practical
implications.</p>

<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ObjectStorage</span></tt> here is a service (repository) that can find any
persistent data object by a global ID. This is necessary, because it
doesn’t actually matter what data object uses the necessary traits
for this use-case.</p>
<p>Again as in EBI, in a bigger system you would need to find some abstraction
layer that does this in a more generic way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When Gordon started showing me this pattern we were both puzzled as how
to actually implement this in the real world. Especially the concept
of binding roles to data objects still confuses us. Most notably why the use
of traits or aggregates should actually constitute a new programming paradigm
instead of just another way to do OOP.</p>
<p>In Scala casting data objects to roles is actually possible by binding traits
to objects at runtime. This is not possible in PHP however and has to be done
statically.</p>
<p>Compared to EBI, DCI focuses drastically on transaction script domain logic, by
suggesting to implement roles for every use-case for the sake of avoiding
side-effects. This is actually is very valuable lesson from this pattern.
Finding means to decrease the complexity of software is always a good thing.
And the explicit definition of this concept as <strong>roles</strong> is actually easy to
explain to other programmers.</p>
<p>One thing that is lacking in DCI is that there is no concrete mechanism to deal
with the boundary to other parts of the system. This is actually a step back
from EBI and I suggest using EBI pattern in combination with DCI to solve this.</p>
<p>The largest benefit from DCI (and its self proclaimed goal) is the mapping from
the users/customers mental model directly into the code by using Use-Cases and
Roles. The communication with the customer about behavior can exclusively focus
on the current context and its use-case. Mapping this behavior to actual data
can then be done in a different step.</p>
<p>This simplification of use-cases and reduction of side-effects between
different parts of the system has other benefits: It can lead to easier to test
code and makes it much easier for developers to develop on small and isolated
parts of the system.</p>

</ul>
<p>Continuing the series, I will talk about Entity, Boundary and Interactor (EBI)
an architectural design pattern. I first heard about it in a keynote video of
<a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/">Uncle Bob</a> on Ruby
Midwest called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-architecture-the-lost-years">“The lost years of architecture”</a>.
This is also described as <a class="reference external" href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">Hexagonal architecture</a> or “Ports and Adapters”
by Alistair Cockburn.</p>
<p>In this pattern any client of the system talks to the model using a model
request object and receives data from the model in form of model responses objects.
Additionally when your model talks to any kind of persistence or subsystem it
should go through an adapter that is replacable. For a model architecture
designed this way, you can replace any part of the UI oder lower layers by
writing new adapters and plug them in.</p>
<div class="section" id="terminology">
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>To iterate the terminology:</p>
<p><strong>Entities</strong> are objects that represent the system data of the application. They don’t contain
much logic except rules that are set in stone and are never going to change
(based on physic or mathematical laws or something).</p>
<p><strong>Interactors</strong> are use-case objects, they contain the business logic that is valid
in the current use-case and works with entities to fullfil their task.</p>
<p>The <strong>boundary</strong> is responsible for translating model request/response into a
format that the UI or actor can understand. They also mediate between model
and lower levels, for example to manage database transactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="an-example">
<h2>An example</h2>
<p>Lets start with an example in PHP code. We will keep using a common example
throughout all blog posts, the usual Bank Account/Money Transfer. The use case
is the money transfer from one bank account (source) to another one
(destination).</p>
<p>We start by implementing the entity <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">BankAccount</span></tt>:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">BankAccount</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It is straightforward to implement the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">withdraw</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">deposit</span></tt>
functionality. The Money object implementation is omitted here.</p>
<p>The Interactor handles the use-case of transfering money from the
source to the destination account:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MoneyTransferRequest</span>

        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">MoneyTransferResponse</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MoneyTransferRequest</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MoneyTransferResponse</span></tt> objects are dumb
php objects (so called data-transfer objects, DTO).</p>
<p>You can see in the example that we use a Data Access object to retrieve the
source and destination account entities from some storage subsystem. To follow the EBI
design pattern, we have to decouple this data access object from the model,
by offering a port (Interface):</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">interface</span> <span class="nx">AccountDaoInterface</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$accountId</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This way our business logic is storage independent.</p>
<p>An example for a boundary would be the requirement for a transaction in
the bank account sample. We need to wrap the whole MoneyTransfer use-case in
a transaction. Lets say the invocation of our Use-Case is controlled through
some kind of application boundary object:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">BankApplicationBoundary</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="nv">$applicationFactory</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">transferMoney</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">MoneyTransferRequest</span> <span class="nv">$request</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$connection</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">applicationFactory</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">createConnection</span><span class="p">();</span>
        <span class="nv">$connection</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">beginTransaction</span><span class="p">();</span>

        <span class="k">try</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nv">$useCase</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">MoneyTransfer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$factory</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">createAccountDao</span><span class="p">());</span>
            <span class="nv">$result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$useCase</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">transferMoney</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$request</span><span class="p">);</span>
            <span class="nv">$connection</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">commit</span><span class="p">();</span>

            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nv">$result</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">catch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">\Exception</span> <span class="nv">$e</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nv">$connection</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">rollback</span><span class="p">();</span>
            <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="nv">$e</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is a very elaborate way to describe that calling the transfer money
use-case is wrapped in a Transaction, another port for the storage system to
manage transactions in this case. The code here is very explicit about
the actual task. In a real application you would probably find a more
generic approach to getting this job done.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="boundary-abstraction">
<h2>Boundary Abstraction</h2>
<p>Thinking about the boundaries I came up with a library several month ago called
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei/context">Context</a>, which I deprecated already
(Reason below).  It allows you to wrap calls to the model by some sort of proxy
that transforms the request and response and also handles transactions and
such. Loosly spoken this was actually some kind of AOP library, using the
limited ways that PHP provides to implement AOP (magic <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__call</span></tt> proxies).</p>
<p>With context you would do something like:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="nv">$context</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">getContext</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="c1">// 1. direct invocation</span>
<span class="nv">$myService</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">MyService</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nv">$context</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">execute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">array</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'service'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$myService</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'method'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'doSomething'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'arguments'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$args</span><span class="p">));</span>

<span class="c1">// 2. proxy wrapping</span>
<span class="nv">$myService</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$context</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">wrap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">MyService</span><span class="p">());</span>
<span class="nv">$myService</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">doSomething</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$args</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The second way is obviously way more readable, but its also rather magic.</p>
<p>I deprecated this library because in the end it wasn’t really helpful that
much. Implementing an application specific proxy for services is done in
almost no time and then it solves all your specific needs. My main problem with
the library is that it tries to magically take away the need to design the
boundary of your application yourself - in a way that is not really coherent to
other developers.</p>
<p>In my own current greenfield applications I quickly went away from using it,
since a custom application proxy as shown in this
<a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/3272909">Gist</a> is really much simpler to implement and
use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-with-symfony2">
<h2>Using with Symfony2</h2>
<p>As I am currently exclusively developing Symfony2/Silex applications, applying
EBI to Symfony2 framework based applications is very important to me. The
biggest difficulty here is the Form layer, escpecially the request data-mapping and
validation concerns, which are normally part of the model. There are two
approaches I came up with to solve this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Build Forms for arrays or DTOs and send them through to the boundary to the model.
You have to validate the data again on the model, which is annoying, but in
this case the clean way. This is not so easy to do with complex forms though
as you need to map the request objects to your entities.</li>
<li>Create a Model Request that wraps and hides the form behind a simple data
mapping API. This way you can make it look as if you would map a DTO onto
an object, but in this case you are using the Form API as the mapper.</li>

<p>The problem with this approach is, that you cant really unit-test these methods
anymore, because the complexity of the form layer mapping cannot be mocked with
this API. Instead your tests always need the full form layer (with validation,
depending services etc.) to allow for real-world esting. Additionally you have
to make the DataMapper throw an exception that you can catch in the controller,
rendering the appropriate response. Using exceptions for controlling executions
paths is not a very good practice though.</p>
<p>Another thing that actually helped was the SensioFrameworkExtraBundle and
ParamConverters. In my project I now have the framework building the Model
Request objects by convention from the HTTP Request, so that I only need to
pass them on and can skip the actual mapping of HTTP Request to Model Request.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pros-and-cons">
<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>This design pattern very closely resembles what Fowler calls <strong>Service Layer</strong>
pattern in PoEAA. EBI is going a bit more into detail by naming individual
parts of the pattern more explicit. Without more restrictions however using
this pattern will drive you towards many of the problems described in my
previous post.</p>
<p>Clean seperation from frameworks is achieved, depending on the actual usage
however only at a significant cost.  Never forget stepping back and thinking
about further abstractions, otherwise applying EBI is leading to lots of code
being manually written.</p>
<p>This already shows one particular annoyance are the data-transfer objects. You
need to invest quite some work to get a mapping working from entities to
transfer objects and back. In the process you will loose the convenience of
“Open Entity Manager in the View”, where you can lazy load any
data you want to access in the view. This is quite a painful step, because you
are loosing lots of flexibility. Much more annoying is the need to update
entities from data-transfer objects, requiring sophisticated code for merging
of partial object graphs.</p>
<p>What this design pattern improves is the testability of code and also the
execution of tests is MUCH better, when you don’t have to go through the whole
application stack to test something.</p>
<p>Implementing behavior into the use-cases also avoids lots of lasagna code
compared to a messy domain driven design. You get a very good overview of
what is actually happening just by looking at the Model Request and Interactor
classes. However depending on the use-case the classes can get very big
and might need lots of collaborators, which make the problem complex again.</p>
<p>It is important to note that aggregating the domain logic in the use-cases
actually means going to some sort of transaction script processing, away from
domain driven design. I am pretty sure that this is not necessarily the
intention of this design pattern from a POV of Uncle Bob. However depending on
the sophistication of the applications domain logic, transaction script is
actually a very good pattern for simple to medium complex use-cases and
I like to have this as a general rule for developers (“Put behavior on the
use-case”).</p>
<p>In conclusion I can partially recommend using the EBI pattern. You have to be
careful to find abstraction layers that keep your code DRY and SOLID however,
something which does not come naturally with this pattern. If you are not
careful you end up with all the “messy points” that I mentioned in my previoius
blog post.</p>
<p>You should be especially careful to avoid lots of DTO &lt;-&gt; Entity Mapping code
by using some code-generation for example to do parts of this job for you. The
worst outcome with this pattern is, when you manually code layers for HTTP
Request/Form =&gt; DTO =&gt; Entity mapping and the other way around.</p>

<h1><a href="2012/08/11/oop_business_applications__trying_to_escape_the_mess.html">OOP Business Applications: Trying to escape the mess</a></h1>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">tl;dr Version: I present a list of problems with OOP business applications from
my personal experience and then introduce 3 approaches that I was put in
contact with over the last year, DCI, EBI and CQRS. This post is an
introduction to a series about this approaches.</p>
</div>
<p>I mentally divide the world of programming into two large parts:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Library and system programming</li>
<li>business applications</li>
</ol>
<p>The first produces code solving technical problems, often in a beautiful and
dedicated way. The second regularly produces mess, hopefully still
serving customers by optimizing their business. This differentation is an
exageration, but from my experience its far easier to run a greenfield business
project into the ground than a new library.</p>
<p>There has to be a reason why so many programmers dedicate much free time to
open source projects. It might be empirical prove, that all our business
projects don’t make us happy at the end of the day and we have to show
ourselves that we can do better.</p>
<p>I enjoy writing business applications more than libraries, but they are also
much more difficult to get right in both social and technical dimensions.  One
motivational driver of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei">my open source activities</a> always was to simplify the technical dimension
of OOP business applications.</p>
<div class="section" id="my-personal-list-of-annoyances">
<h2>My Personal List of Annoyances</h2>
<p>This blog post is not about blaming customers (as the usual suspect), its about
finding the problems in usual OOP code of business systems from my experience
with PHP projects. To keep things short, I will list my <em>personal</em> list of
techincal annoyances in business projects in no particular order. These are
highly subjective points.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Getter/Setter Madness of Objects that are used to store data into
databases. Leading to huge objects that are essentially just meaningless
stores of data.</li>
<li>Updating complex object graphs from user input.</li>
<li>Seperation of model, controller and views, especially when dealing with
forms. This is very complicated to achieve.</li>
<li>Lazy Loading and Query performance problems when using an ORM. Additionally
replacing parts of the views with hand-crafted SQL is often difficult and/or
time intensive, when already using an ORM.</li>
<li>Inability to decouple code that was written with CRUD (generators and
utilities) in mind towards more domain driven code, when the requirements
change.</li>
<li>Dependency mess leading to hard to test code, generally leading to untested
applications. Too often frameworks create huge dependencies that
make your domain model messy and complex to mock in tests.</li>
<li>Focus on synchroneous request/response handling makes later usage of message
queues very complicated and expensive to refactor towards.</li>
<li>Tight coupling of model against the framework code.</li>
<li>Junior developers have too much freedom, when there is not much structure in
the code, but rather just a big ball of mud. Additionally with the tight
coupling of so many components, junior developers get easily lost in the code
and produce unexpected side-effects.</li>
<li>Use-cases easily span more than 5 classes. To grasp the interaction you have
to keep lots of code in your head, especially complicated for junior
developers again. As they cannot really work on a problem in isolation.</li>
<li>Constant violations of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29">SOLID</a> principles
due to framework or persistence requirements.</li>
<li>Compared to library development, user-facing applications often have much
higher coupling between classes and namespaces. In libraries its often easy
to find different concerns, but in applications they seem hard to divide for
developers.</li>
<li>In combination with a rich javascript client, requirements to update objects
through their CRUD API produces concurrency and lost-update hell, that
dynamic server-side applications could mostly avoid before.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially if you work in a tight schedule, project based environment where
the decision makers sell rapid application development and prototyping, then you
often have only one, maybe one and a half attempts to get the big picture
right. From that moment on you have to build on that decision and hope for the
best.</p>
<p>We have tried not to go the RAD+CRUD tools ways in several projects, to escape
the problems listed above. But without changes in your mindest you end up with
hand written mess, compared to getting there with tools.</p>
<p>Specifically <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">Domain Driven Design</a> applied naively can make
the problem even worse. It easily leads to lasagna code, where you have layers
of layers that are very hard to understand. Personally I prefer spagetthi code
over lasagna code, because its comparatively simpler to understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="finding-new-approaches">
<h2>Finding new Approaches</h2>
<p>Rather than to embrace the suck and dive deeper into CRUD architectures, I felt
there has to be some solution to organize business models structurely to avoid
all (or most) of these problems. In the PHP world with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.symfony.com">Symfony2</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.doctrine-project.org">Doctrine2</a>
you have a powerful toolbox to avoid many of the problems above, but it is
still not simple to write clean object oriented applications.</p>
<p>After years of participation in both open source projects I still feel there is
a missing puzzle piece, to reach a clean seperation of all the model concerns
from framework and persistence.</p>
<p>At some point I would really like to close the gap between desired technical
state of a project and the state it is actually in. I know there is no size
fits all solution, but I fell a checklist of architectural patterns with pro
and con arguments allows me to adjust the expectations about how a system looks
in the end.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/go_oh">Gordon</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/spriebsch">Stefan</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/tom_noise">Thomas</a>
I was introduced to several approaches to OO application design that I
started to explore in the past last months:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_context_and_interaction">Data, Context, Interaction (DCI)</a> - which Gordon
studied alot</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">Entity, Boundary, Interactor (EBI)</a>, also called Hexagonal
architecture or “Ports and adapters”. Gained popularity after <a class="reference external" href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-architecture-the-lost-years">Uncle Bobs talk
at Ruby Midwest</a>
last year.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-query_separation">Command-Query-Responsibility-Segregation (CQRS)</a> well described in a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.udidahan.com/2009/12/09/clarified-cqrs/">blost post by Udi Dahan</a> and in a hands on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.viddler.com/v/dc528842">one
day video class</a> by Greg Young.</li>
</ul>
<p>They are not new and have all been around for several years already. I would
describe all three of them as architectural design patterns, though some people
might probably disagreee with this classification. All three approaches make
you think about application development beyond just “service layers” in
radically new ways. All three have helped me rethink business applications in
different ways.</p>
<p>In the next weeks I will talk about each of these approaches individually, show
some examples and then wrap up my thoughts about all of them.</p>

        <div class="section" id="virtual-machines-with-vagrant-veewee-and-puppet">
<h1><a href="2012/05/31/virtual_machines_with_vagrant__veewee_and_puppet.html">Virtual Machines with Vagrant, Veewee and Puppet</a></h1>
<p>I have been playing with Vagrant these last days, a tool to automate Virtualbox
VM management very efficiently. Being always late to new technologies
investigating Vagrant now felt about right. I am using Virtualbox for
virtualization for about a year now but have build all my boxes manually. I
have these machines setup:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Windows 7</li>
<li>Ubuntu with lots of crazy PHP builds</li>
<li>Ubuntu with Oracle, PostgreSQL for Doctrine Unit-Tests</li>
</ul>
<p>The main benefit from this is that I don’t have to clutter my main machine with
packages and dependencies that might potentially break.</p>
<p>To benefit from Virtualization on a larger scale I wanted to investigate
automation of box-building and was pointed to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a>. This is a ruby tool that allows to copy and
modify virtualboxes on the fly. You define a basebox and inherit from this box
in your projects. Whenever you work on the project you start a copy of this
basebox and install more system-dependencies using Chef or Puppet.
That allows you to put the VM into a defined state just for this project. No
matter how many different and weird dependencies you need, they will always be
in this VM that is just created for the project and destroyed at the end of the
day.</p>
<p>I am using Ubuntu (currently 12.04) and tried starting with the Vagrant
example.  It fails, because their example box uses a more current Virtualbox
Guest Additions. To be able to use vagrant, you need a basebox with the
virtualbox and guest additions versions matching correctly.</p>
<p>To build your own Virtualbox you can use the Vagrant plugin <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee">Veewee</a>. Install it from Github to get
all the latest VM templates:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee.git
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>veewee
<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo gem install bundler
<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo bundle install
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">vagrant</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;bundle exec vagrant&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You need Ruby and Gems installed for this to work. Veewee can be installed
using Gems, but this not necessarily gives you the version with the most recent
templates that match your own operating system version.</p>
<p>Now lets define our own basebox definition and copy from an existing template
that Veewee provides:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>vagrant basebox define <span class="s1">'beberlei-ubuntu-12.04-i386-php'</span> <span class="s1">'ubuntu-server-12.04-i386'</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This creates a copy from the default ubuntu server template into a folder
<cite>definitions/beberlei-ubuntu-12.04-i386-php</cite>. You can start modifying the files
in there to adjust the build process of the virtual machine image. For me its
important to modify the definitions.rb and add the following, otherwise
building the VMs fails:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>:virtualbox <span class="o">=</span>&gt; <span class="o">{</span> : <span class="nv">vm_options</span> <span class="o">=</span>&gt; <span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;pae&quot;</span> <span class="o">=</span>&gt; <span class="s2">&quot;on&quot;</span><span class="o">]}</span>,
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can then open up the postinstall.sh and install more packages that you need
in your personal basebox. For example a LAMP stack. Do this right after the
lines that do <cite>apt-get install -y</cite>:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">DEBIAN_FRONTEND</span><span class="o">=</span>noninteractive
apt-get -y install php5 php5-cli php5 mysql-server-5.5 libapache2-mod-php5
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you are done you can start building a virtualbox image with:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>vagrant basebox build
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Make sure not to start typing in the console window that open ups. It is
automatically controlled from a ruby script and every change to the keysequence
breaks the building. This step takes a while. (Enough to write a blog post
while watching a boring football game for example).</p>
<p>When this is done, you can verify and export the VM into virtualbox/vagrant.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>veewee vbox validate <span class="s1">'beberlei-ubuntu-12.04-i386-php'</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>vagrant basebox <span class="nb">export</span> <span class="s1">'beberlei-ubuntu-12.04-i386-php'</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>vagrant box add <span class="s1">'beberlei-ubuntu-12.04-i386-php'</span> <span class="s1">'beberlei-ubuntu-12.04-i386-php.box'</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now this box is also available as Vagrant base box. For example in a project
that we want to use with vagrant, do:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>myproject/
<span class="nv">$ </span>vagrant init <span class="s1">'beberlei-ubuntu-12.04-i386-php'</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>vagrant up
<span class="nv">$ </span>vagrant ssh
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Although the blog-title suggests it, Puppet hasnt been used much up to this
point. The use of puppet with Vagrant will be part of a next blog post.</p>

        <div class="section" id="doctrine-switches-from-lgpl-to-mit">
<h1><a href="2012/05/26/doctrine_goes_mit.html">Doctrine switches from LGPL to MIT</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<div>tl;dr We moved all the Doctrine PHP projects from LGPL to MIT license
succesfully in roughly 4 weeks. For that we used a small web-based tool to
ask the permission of 358 authors that contributed in the last 6 years.</div></blockquote>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.doctrine-project.org">Doctrine project</a> has been LGPL
licensed since it was started in 2006. When I first started contributing in the
project late in 2009 we were constantly asked about changing the license to a
permissive license such as <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT</a> or
New-BSD.  My subjective feeling is that there are much more libraries with
permissive licenses than 10 years ago. And there are others that <a class="reference external" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13556_3-20071811-61/the-open-source-license-landscape-is-changing/">back my
feeling up with facts</a>.
The fear of getting screwed when using a permissive license has probably
declined in favor of the benefits. <a class="reference external" href="http://pooteeweet.org/blog/2084">As Lukas puts it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Maybe with enough experience you start to realize that it happens close to
never that a proprietary fork of an open source project ends up outpacing
the original project.</div></blockquote>
<p>We wanted all the benefits of permissive licenses as well.  So at the beginning
of this year we as Doctrine project first started to investigate how the task
of switching the license could be done. After a short email with the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fsf.org">FSF</a> it was clear that we had to get the approval of every
single committer or remove their code.</p>
<p>VLC <a class="reference external" href="http://www.videolan.org/press/lgpl.html">succesfully attempted a license change</a> last year from GPL to LGPL, so we
we’re hopeful to get this done. After discussing with Lukas we came up with the
idea of a tool that helps this process, so <a class="reference external" href="http://dlm.beberlei.de">I wrote it</a>. It features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Import of all commits from one or many Github projects</li>
<li>Aggregation of commits to authors based on e-mail adress from Git log</li>
<li>Status approved/not-approved for every author.</li>
<li>An e-mail engine to send a request for approval to every author using
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mailgun.net">the awesome Mailgun service</a>, who has not approved
yet. We use Mailgun for fun and to have a way to act on bounces easily.</li>
<li>Admin functionality to mark commits as “trivial or deleted”.</li>
<li>An audit trail to account for all changes and who has done them.</li>
<li>Symfony2/Doctrine2 application with debian packaging using FPM.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project is not yet open-sourced but will be when I have some time to clean
up the hardcoded passwords and write a small README on how to adjust the
templates.</p>
<p>After importing the commits of all the LGPL licensed Doctrine projects we
realized that we have 358 unique committers and about 40-50 without an e-mail
address (from the old SVN days). So we started googling for nicknames and
eventually collected all e-mail addresses except maybe 6-8 missing ones.</p>
<p>Now after 4 weeks of bi-weekly e-mail reminders, everyone except 16 committers have
accepted the license change. No single person refused the change. All commits
of the 16 people left we’re luckily not part of the code base anymore when we
completly rewrote Doctrine 2 or trivial one-line changes.</p>
<p>I am very happy to announce that Doctrine is now an MIT licensed project. Have
fun with it.</p>

<h1><a href="2010/02/07/resources-for-a-php-and-hudson-ci-integration.html">Resources for a PHP and Hudson CI Integration</a></h1>
<p>Yesterday I finally had the time to setup my first continuous
integration environment. Possible solutions for CI are
<a class="reference external" href="http://phpundercontrol.org/about.html">phpUnderControl</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hudson-ci.org">Hudson</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.arbitracker.org">Arbit</a>. Although phpUnderControl is the
most wide-spread, but from I heard complex to setup/maintain, solution
[STRIKEOUT:supposedly a hack] and Arbit just in an early Alpha I decided
to give Hudson a shoot. Another reason for this decision, I heard it has
a simple plugin architecture and is easy to install and use.
Additionally Hudson is easily integrated into
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.netbeans.org">Netbeans</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.redmine.org">Redmine</a>, and I use both tools regularly in
development.</p>
<p>My motivation to dive into CI is easily explained. I just never felt it
was necessary to add a continuous integration enviroment to my projects,
since I had one or two simple bash scripts that did the job. In general
this is rather annoying, because they mostly only run PHPUnit and have
to be done using a cronjob or manually, without any real process of
notification. Additionally you have no way to navigate the test-results,
code-coverage and no history of the last builds. For projects like
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.doctrine-project.org">Doctrine 2</a> we have the additional
requirement to support 4 different database platforms, i.e. 4 different
PHPUnit configurations. Currently that is solved by me using a Bash
script that iterates over the configuration file names and invokes
PHPUnit.</p>
<p>There are already some awesome sources how to get Hudson and PHP
working. I’ll list them here:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sebastian_bergmann/sets/72157622541690849/">Sebastian Bergmann’s Howto in
Screenshots</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://luhman.org/blog/2009/12/16/installing-hudson-phing-phpunit-and-git-ubuntu">David Luhman’s series on PHP and
Hudson</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://blog.jepamedia.org/2009/10/28/continuous-integration-for-php-with-hudson/">Justin Palmers Guide to install PHP and Hudson (With
Screenshots)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All those guides are already awesome and I would recommend choosing one
of those to install Hudson, I think i can’t add anything new to those. I
have used Sebastians Howto, however i also like the third one. David
Luhmans guide adds lots of details that are important to get the
different parts of a build process to work.</p>
<p>Now what these tutorials all do is that they use a bash command to
execute the build process or specifiy an Ant Build file. However there
is also a Phing Build process plugin for Hudson that allows to specify
the build.xml targets to execute in the process. From the “Available
Plugins” list you can choose the “Phing plugin”.</p>
<p>After installation you have to configure the Phing install. The <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Phing+Plugin">Phing
Plugin Wiki
Page</a> shows how
to do this. You have to go to “Manage Hudson” =&gt; “Configure System” and
look for Phing. There you find the dialog to configure your phing
installations.</p>
<p>In the context of choosing a build script for your project you can now
choose “Phing” instead of Ant:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="" src="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sebastian_bergmann/4046549930/in/set-72157622541690849/"/>
</div>
<p>You can enter the targets to build, for example on my local Hudson
instance I only execute “test” for Doctrine 2, since I am not interested
in the building and deployment onto the PEAR channel at this development
stage.</p>
<p>From inside Netbeans you can then start builds by pointing to the Hudson
instance. See this tutorial by one of the <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.sun.com/joshis/entry/hudson_integration_in_netbeans_6">Hudson + Netbeans
Developers</a>.
You can then start all the builds from inside Netbeans and be notified
of the success or failure.</p>

<h1><a href="2010/05/02/testing-database-locks-with-phpunit-and-gearman.html">Testing Database Locks with PHPUnit and Gearman</a></h1>
<p>For the Beta 2 release of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.doctrine-project.org">Doctrine
2</a> we plan to integrate pessimistic
Database-level locks across all the supported vendors (MySQL, Oracle,
PostgreSql, IBM DB2 so far). This means row-level locking as defined in
the ANSI SQL Standard using “SELECT .. FOR UPDATE” will be available
optionally in DQL Queries and Finder methods. The Implementation of this
extension to SELECT statements is rather trivial, however functional
testing of this feature is not.</p>
<p>A general approach would look like this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Run Query 1 and 2 with FOR UPDATE into the background</li>
<li>Have both queries lock the row for a specified time x (using sleep)</li>
<li>Verify that one of the two processes/threads runs approximately 2*x
the lock time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since PHP does not support process forking or threads naturally you run
into a serious problem. How do you execute two database queries in
parallel and verify that indeed one query is locking read access for the
second one?</p>
<p>Side note: There are some drawbacks to this testing approach. It could
be that one background threads finishes the lock sleep already when the
second just starts. The locking would work in these cases, however the
lock time would not nearly be 2*x seconds, producing a test-failure. We
are talking about a functional test though and I will accept a failure
from time to time just to be 99% sure that locking works.</p>
<p>Solving this problem with Gearman provides a pretty nice “real-world”
example for the Job-Server that I wanted to share. This blog post
contains a stripped down code-example from the Doctrine 2 testsuite. If
you are interested, you can see the complete Gearman Locking Tests in
<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/beberlei/doctrine2/tree/lock-support/tests/Doctrine/Tests/ORM/Functional/Locking/">on
GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Gearman allows to register worker processes with the job-server and
offers clients to execute jobs on those workers in parallel. After
installing the Gearman job-server and PHP pecl/gearman extension
(<a class="reference external" href="http://toys.lerdorf.com/archives/51-Playing-with-Gearman.html">Rasmus Lerdorf has a post on
installation</a>)
we can go on writing our locking tests with Gearman.</p>
<p>The first bit is the worker, a PHP script that tries to acquire a
database lock and then sleeps for a second. The return value of this
script is the total time required for acquiring the lock and sleeping.</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">class LockAgentWorker</span>
<span class="x">{</span>
<span class="x">    public function findWithLock($job)</span>
<span class="x">    {</span>
<span class="x">        $fixture = $this-&gt;processWorkload($job); // setup doctrine in here</span>

<span class="x">        $s = microtime(true);</span>
<span class="x">        $this-&gt;em-&gt;beginTransaction();</span>

<span class="x">        $entity = $this-&gt;em-&gt;find($fixture['entityName'], $fixture['entityId'], $fixture['lockMode']);</span>

<span class="x">        sleep(1);</span>
<span class="x">        $this-&gt;em-&gt;rollback(); // clean up doctrine</span>

<span class="x">        return (microtime(true) - $s);</span>
<span class="x">    }</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The glue-code for the worker script contains of the registering of the
worker method with the job-server and a simple infinite loop:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">$lockAgent = new LockAgentWorker();</span>

<span class="x">$worker = new \GearmanWorker();</span>
<span class="x">$worker-&gt;addServer();</span>
<span class="x">$worker-&gt;addFunction(&quot;findWithLock&quot;, array($lockAgent, &quot;findWithLock&quot;));</span>

<span class="x">while($worker-&gt;work()) {</span>
<span class="x">    if ($worker-&gt;returnCode() != GEARMAN_SUCCESS) {</span>
<span class="x">        break;</span>
<span class="x">    }</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We need two running workers for this to work, since one worker only
processes one task at a time. Just open up two terminals and launch the
php scripts. They will wait for their first task to process.</p>
<p>Now we need to write our PHPUnit TestCase, which will contain a
GearmanClient to execute two of the “findWithLock” in parallel. Our
locking assertion will work like this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Register two tasks for the “findWithLock” method that access the same
database row.</li>
<li>Register a completed callback using
“GearmanClient::setCompleteCallback()” that collects the run-time of
the individual workers.</li>
<li>Execute this tasks in parallel using “GearmanClient::runTasks()”.</li>
<li>Assert that the maximum run-time is around 2 seconds (since each
worker sleeps 1 second)</li>
</ol>
<p>The code for this steps could look like:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">class GearmanLockTest extends \Doctrine\Tests\OrmFunctionalTestCase</span>
<span class="x">{</span>
<span class="x">    private $gearman = null;</span>
<span class="x">    private $maxRunTime = 0;</span>
<span class="x">    private $articleId;</span>

<span class="x">    public function testLockIsAquired()</span>
<span class="x">    {</span>
<span class="x">        // .. write fixture data into the database</span>

<span class="x">        $gearman = new \GearmanClient();</span>
<span class="x">        $gearman-&gt;addServer();</span>
<span class="x">        $gearman-&gt;setCompleteCallback(array($this, &quot;gearmanTaskCompleted&quot;));</span>

<span class="x">        $workload = array(); // necessary workload data to configure workers</span>
<span class="x">        $gearman-&gt;addTask(&quot;findWithLock&quot;, serialize($workload));</span>
<span class="x">        $gearman-&gt;addTask(&quot;findWithLock&quot;, serialize($workload));</span>

<span class="x">        $gearman-&gt;runTasks();</span>

<span class="x">        $this-&gt;assertTrue($this-&gt;maxRunTime &gt;= 2);</span>
<span class="x">    }</span>

<span class="x">    public function gearmanTaskCompleted($task)</span>
<span class="x">    {</span>
<span class="x">        $this-&gt;maxRunTime = max($this-&gt;maxRunTime, $task-&gt;data());</span>
<span class="x">    }</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now if both workers are waiting for processing the task we can run this
test and get a green bar for a working lock support.</p>

<h1><a href="2010/01/08/immutable-datetime-objects.html">Immutable DateTime Objects</a></h1>
<p>One serious drawback of <a class="reference external" href="http://de.php.net/DateTime">PHPs DateTime
extension</a> is the mutability of its
instances. It can lead to serious bugs if a DateTime instance is passed
between different functions and is modified at unexpected places.
Additionally this possibly rules out several optimizations for scripts
that make very heavy use of dates and could share references to equal
timestamps.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> All the code assumes that you work with one timezone only!</p>
<p>The following code is an immutable version of PHP’s DateTime. All setter
methods throw an exception and add(),sub() and modify() clone the
current instance, apply the operation and return the new instance.</p>

<p>Its not the prettiest code, but it works.</p>
<p>A next optimization would be a <strong>DateFactory</strong> that manages DateTime
instances by returning already existing instances for specific dates.
This is not a perfect solution, since you won’t be able to enforce a
single instance when you are using the relative descriptive dates or
when calculating with dates using add(), sub() and modify(), however for
lots of dates created from a database or other external source it might
be quite a powerful optimization depending on your use-case:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">namespace Whitewashing\DateTime;</span>

<span class="x">class DateFactory</span>
<span class="x">{</span>
<span class="x">    static private $_dates = array();</span>

<span class="x">    static public function create($hour, $minute, $second, $month, $day, $year)</span>
<span class="x">    {</span>
<span class="x">        $ts = mktime($hour, $minute, $second, $month, $day, $year);</span>
<span class="x">        if (!isset(self::$_dates[$ts])) {</span>
<span class="x">            self::$_dates[$ts] = new DateTime('@'.$ts);</span>
<span class="x">        }</span>
<span class="x">        return self::$_dates[$ts];</span>
<span class="x">    }</span>

<span class="x">    static public function createFromMysqlDate($mysqlDate)</span>
<span class="x">    {</span>
<span class="x">        list($date, $time) = explode(&quot; &quot;, $mysqlDate);</span>
<span class="x">        if($time == null) {</span>
<span class="x">            $hour = $minute = $second = 0;</span>
<span class="x">        } else {</span>
<span class="x">            list($hour, $minute, $second) = explode(&quot;:&quot;, $time);</span>
<span class="x">        }</span>
<span class="x">        list($year, $month, $day) = explode(&quot;-&quot;, $mysqlDate);</span>
<span class="x">        return self::create($hour, $minute, $second, $month, $day, $year);</span>
<span class="x">    }</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This includes some date time calculations and date creation with
mktime() and DateTimes unix timestamp capabilities to be able to work.
Otherwise the sharing of instances could not be implemented. If you need
to create shareable instances from other formats you could just create
another creation method for it and convert the format for create() to be
used.</p>
