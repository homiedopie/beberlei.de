Knights Tour using Warndorff's rule
===================================

When using `Warndorff's
rule <http://web.telia.com/~u85905224/knight/eWarnsd.htm>`_ for solving
the Knights Tour problem, the solution is found within a second. It took
some time for me to realize it in PASCAL though using a **RECORD** type
to match the jumps to the number of free fields and then sort them. You
can view my source code
`here <http://www.beberlei.de/sources/knightstour.txt>`_.
