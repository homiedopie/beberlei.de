A knight's tour solver in pascal
================================

My professor has a task on the current problem set of my pascal
programming course to program, demanding a recursive program finding a
solution to the `knights tour problem <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight's_tour>`_ on a chess board
of size n>=3 given a starting position. I used a backtracking algorithm
(at least that is what wikipedia tells me it is), by trying all possible
combinations and setting steps back, when they do not lead to a
solution.

Beginning with n = 7 my algorithms gets very slow, caused by the
backtracking algorithm which is not very efficient. I found some
interesting articles regarding this problem using graph theory to solve
it. Some pretty big minds have thought about the problem, I guess its
not for me to find such an solution for a little task of the weekly
problem set.
