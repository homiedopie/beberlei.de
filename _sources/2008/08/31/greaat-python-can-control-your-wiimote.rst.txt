Greaat, Python can control your Wiimote
=======================================

In the last days I had lots of time to play with my Wiimote and its
bluetooth capabilities. Sadly there is actively supported driver in non-C
(and I am not the biggest C programmer). I found this little prototype
driver written in Python by Will Woods which is using pyBluez to
communicate with my wiimote and have extended it quite a bit.
`WiiLinux <http://www.wiili.org>`_ is a huge resource that offers
information on reverse engineering of the Wiimote protocol.

The driver is still far from finished or usable outside some demo
applications, but that might still be included in the future. You can
`download this little
goodie <http://www.beberlei.de/sources/wiipylib-0.1.tar.gz>`_ and have a
look at it.
