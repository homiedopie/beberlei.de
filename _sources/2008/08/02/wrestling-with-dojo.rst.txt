Wrestling with Dojo
===================

I have to complain about the `Dojo
Toolkit <http://www.dojotoolkit.org>`_ (Considering the `project I am
using this for <http://www.whitewashing.de/blog/articles/50>`_). It has
the worst documentation and API guides I have ever seen. The
documentation (called the Dojo Book) has an unnecessary complex
structure to click through and its contents are wrapped around examples
that are so overly complex that you click away the pages when they get
smashed at your head.

The API too, has no clear structure and hides its contents behind
cryptic names such as "dnd", "fx", "rpc". Descriptions of the functions
sum to very small sentences and additional options are listed without
any description at all other than a link to where they are defined in
the project. There are no short examples given to any function like
`jQuery <http://www.jquery.com>`_ does.

In general I think the Dojos Site is too complex and hard to navigate.
The layout seems to change massively on each click and you it is hard
recognize common patterns. Dear Dojo Team, please make your project more
accessible!
