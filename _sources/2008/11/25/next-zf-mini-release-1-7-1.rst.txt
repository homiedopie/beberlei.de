Next ZF Mini Release: 1.7.1
===========================

In the next days the next mini release of the Zend Framework will be
released and I want to keep you up to date of my progress on it.
I got lots of feedback on the jQuery component and also had the
possibility to fix some bugs and documentation issues. I also fixed some
minor bugs that have been in the ``Zend_Soap_Wsdl`` stuff i added for the
1.7 release.
And a question for the 1.8 release that is due around February 2009:
What do you think is missing in the jQuery support to ZF? Any widgets or
stuff that you want to have included?
