Composer and Azure Websites Git Deployment
==========================================

Continuing my series on PHP PaaS Clouds (`Fortrabbit
<http://fortrabbit.com/>`_), I turn to Microsoft Azure today. After some
research I found out Azure supports post deployment hooks to run
Composer and allows you to configure environment variables from the Management
console.

Microsoft launched `Azure Websites
<https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/web-sites/>`_ in June this
year.  It is a platform as a service solution where you can deploy your
websites via FTP or Git. With Azure Websites you can avoid having to deal with
the complex deployment automation that is necessary for `Azure Hosted Cloud
Services <https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/features/cloud-services/>`_.
As long as your website only requires an SQLServer, MySQL or external APIs you
can actually achieve quite a lot already.

For a `Symfony2 <http://www.symfony.com>`_, `Silex
<http://www.silex-project.org>`_ or any other modern project however you want
`Composer <http://www.getcomposer.org>`_ support during the deployment as
long as failures with Composer don't break your site.

It turns out that Azure Websites - to support other platforms that require
compiling - actually has an extremely robust deployment system (as far as I
understood its internals). The Git repository is separated from the actual code
that is served from the webserver and a number of old checkouts is kept to
allow rollbacks through the Web interface. Once a Git push was recognized,
Azure websites will execute a build step, and then copy all the files over to a
directory with the name of the Git SHA hash. This directory is then symlinked
to the document root.

If Composer fails during this step, the website will still be served from the
currently running version and you don't have to face unexpected downtime.

To actually run Composer as a post-deployment tool you have to do some manual
work. Create a ``.deployment`` file in your project root folder:

.. code-block:: ini

    [config]
    command = "D:\Program Files (x86)\PHP\v5.3\php.exe" build_azure.php

If you are using PHP 5.4, then you probably have to change the command version
name to "v5.4", but I haven't tested this.

Then you need to create the ``build_azure.php`` file that is referenced in the
deployment command. The actual implementation is up to you, my version is
the most simple one:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    if (!file_exists("composer.phar")) {
        $url = 'https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar';
        file_put_contents("composer.phar", file_get_contents($url));
    }

    $_SERVER['argv'][1] = "update";
    $_SERVER['argv'][2] = "--prefer-dist";
    $_SERVER['argv'][3] = "-v";
    require "composer.phar";

.. note::

    This currently only works with a Composer version, where
    `PR-1341 <https://github.com/composer/composer/pull/1341>`_ is applied.
    You can check out `my Composer fork
    <https://github.com/beberlei/composer/tree/GH-1339>`_ and run
    ``./bin/compile`` to generate a composer.phar that works.

Instead of using this approach, you could ship ``composer.phar`` with your repository for example.
You can of course execute additional steps in the ``build_azure.php``, for example warmup caches.
