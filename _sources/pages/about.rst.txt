About
=====

My name is Benjamin Eberlei and I have been writing this blog on and off
since 2005. Not all posts survived migrating through different blog engines
since then, only those starting in 2008 and older. I am a `programmer
<https://github.com/beberlei>`_ and `founder of the company Tideways
<https://tideways.com>`_, that builds a Profiler, Monitoring and Exception
Tracking tool for PHP applications. 

I have blogged about a wide range of topics including programming, software
architecture and craftsmanship, Symfony, Doctrine, Ansible, Zend Framework 1,
Vagrant, Side Projects and most recently Bootstrapping. If you are interested
in some of the historic discussions please `have a look at the archives
</archive.html>`_.

If you don't want to miss any new content, then you should `follow me on Twitter
