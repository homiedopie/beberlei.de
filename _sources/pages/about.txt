About
=====

My name is Benjamin Eberlei and I have been writing this blog on and off
since 2005. Not all posts survived migrating through different blog engines
since then, only those starting in 2008 and older. I
am a `programmer <https://github.com/beberlei>`_, `trainer and consultant
<https://qafoo.com>`_ and since recently also a `founder of the company
Tideways <https://tideways.io>`_, where we trace, profile and monitor PHP applications. 

I have blogged about a wide range of topics including programming, software
architecture and craftsmanship, Symfony, Doctrine, Ansible, Zend Framework 1,
Vagrant, Side Projects. If you are interested in some of the historic
discussions please `have a look at the archives </archive.html>`_.

If you don't want to miss any new content, then you should `follow me on Twitter
