Code & Coffee Bonn
==================

On last years `SoCraTes Conference <http://www.socrates-conference.de/>`_ I had
the pleasure to meet `Sandro Mancuso <https://twitter.com/sandromancuso>`_ from
the London Software Craftsmanship Community (LSCC). Following his Twitter
account I stumbled upon a meetup concept called "Code & Coffee" which the LSCC
organizes very regularly. At a "Code & Coffee" developers would meet up early
in the morning before work to discuss and hack at some coffee place. 

I liked the idea very much and started such an event in Bonn. Our first
test-event was a success, so that we now open up the concept to anyone who
wants to join.

There is a `Google+ Community Code & Coffee Bonn
<https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/118268893445703199868>`_ where you can
join and get regular invites to the events.

Our next event is on March 26th. For more details see the Google+ page.

Looking forward to seeing you there!
