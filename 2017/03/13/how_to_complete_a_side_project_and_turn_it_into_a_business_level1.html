<h1>How to complete a side project and turn it into a business (Level 1)</h1>
<p>Almost four years ago I wrote about <a class="reference external" href="https://beberlei.de/2013/04/06/a_failed_side_project.html">Lessons learned: A failed side project</a> and when I stumbled
across the post <a class="reference external" href="http://ewanvalentine.io/how-to-never-complete-anything/">How to *never* complete anything</a> several days ago I
felt it was time for an update. Ewan&#8217;s post covers similar lessons learned that I
wrote about in my post and I heard about many side projects that failed
because of similar mistakes.</p>
<p>There was an argument on HackerNews what a side project is, so I want to
clarify this up front. I am talking about side-projects written with some intend
of turning them into a business, as opposed to side-projects that are started for
learning new technical skills.</p>
<p>Three years ago I have started working on a PHP profiling and monitoring
side-project, which I turned into a business called <a class="reference external" href="https://tideways.io">Tideways</a>. In this post I wanted to share some of the reasons why
I think this project was successful.</p>
<p>The idea for &#8220;XHProf as a Service&#8221; was on my &#8220;Side Project Ideas&#8221; trello board,
where I write everything down that I want to try or experiment with. I have
picked it out for implementation as my new side project, because that month I
would have needed this for a large scale load-testing project at my job with
<a class="reference external" href="https://qafoo.com">Qafoo</a>. It was not the first time I needed this for
myself, I felt a regular pain that a product like this didn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>Not wanting to make the same mistakes, I have applied all the lessons learned from 2013:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>I picked a small scope</strong>: The first version contained very few features, re-used
the existing xhprof PHP extension (Tideways now has its own) and instead of a
daemon collecting data in realtime used a cronjob to collect data from a
directory every minute. After six months of development I removed half of
the features I experimented with to reduce the scope again.</li>
<li><strong>I did not compete with the established competition on features</strong>, instead I focussed
on two single features that I thought where the most important: Response time
monitoring and Callgraph profiling. By focussing on a niche (PHP intead of all
languages) I was able to provide a better solution than existing generic tools (obviously biased).</li>
<li><strong>I did not work all alone on the project</strong>, instead I have immediately enlisted
alpha-users that gave valuable feedback after 1 month of work and some of
them are still our most active customers; brought in my employer Qafoo who is
now a shareholder in the new business; formed business partnerships with
companies that are now our biggest customers and re-sellers.</li>
<li><strong>I did not keep the idea secret</strong>, when I announced our beta program
publically in June 2014 the launch newsletter list received 250 sign ups and 60
Twitter followers in a few hours.</li>
<li><strong>I choose boring technology</strong>, using a monolithic Symfony, PHP, MySQL
backend and jQuery frontend stack allowed me to iterate very fast on new
features with technology that I already mastered. I <a class="reference external" href="http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">spent three innovation
tokens</a> on using Golang for
the daemon, using Elasticsearch as TimeSeries database and later on learning
C for the PHP extension.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making these decisions has not magically turned my side project into a
profit-generating business. However I have avoided all the problems that I have
written about in my failed side project lessons post from four years ago.</p>
<p>The fast iterations on a small scope combined with early user feedback showed
that this idea will work as a business and it was worthwhile to keep pushing
for two years, until the project generated enough revenue after all other costs
to pay my full time salary.</p>
<p>This felt like passing level 1 in getting a bootstrapped side project of the
ground (there are many more levels after that).</p>
