<h1>Monolithic Repositories with PHP and Composer</h1>
<blockquote>
<div>tl;dr Monolithic repositories can bring a lot of benefits. I prototyped
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei/fiddler">Fiddler</a> that complements Composer
to add dependency management for monolithic repositories to PHP.</div></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/iam_asm89">Alexander</a> for discussing this
topic with me as well as reviewing the draft of this post.</p>
<p>As Git and Composer are more ubiquitous in open-source projects and within
companies, monolithic repositories containing multiple projects have become a
bit of a bad practice. This is a similar trend to how monolithic applications
are out of fashion and the recent focus on microservices and Docker.</p>
<p>Composer has made it possible to create many small packages and distribute them
easily through Packagist. This has massively improved the PHP ecosystem by
increasing re-usability and sharing.</p>
<p>But it is important to consider package distribution and development seperate
from each other. The current progress in package manager tooling comes at a
cost for version control productivity, because Composer, NPM, Bower force you
to have exactly one repository for one package to benefit from the
reusability/distribution.</p>
<p>This blog post compares monolithic repositories with one repository per package
approach. It focuses on internal projects and repositories in organizations and
companies. I will discuss open source projects in a follow-up post.</p>
<div class="section" id="workflow-at-facebook-google-twitter">
<h2>Workflow at Facebook, Google, Twitter</h2>
<p>The move towards smaller repositories is called into question by three extremely
productive organizations that work at incredible scale.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Facebook <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.facebooklive.com/videos/561/big-code-developer-infrastructure-at-facebook-s-scale">mentioned in their talk &#8220;Big Code: Developer Infrastructure at
Facebook&#8217;s Scale&#8221;</a>
that they are going to merge their three big code repositories Server, iOS
and Android into a single big repository over the course of 2015.</li>
<li>Google open-sourced <a class="reference external" href="http://bazel.io">Bazel</a>, the build tool behind a huge
chunk of their codebase managed in a single Perforce repository with over 20 million
commits (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.perforce.com/sites/default/files/still-all-one-server-perforce-scale-google-wp.pdf">Reference</a>).</li>
<li>Twitter, Foursquare and Square are working on their clone of Google&#8217;s Bazel
build system called <a class="reference external" href="https://pantsbuild.github.io/">Pants</a>. It is also
designed for monolithic repositories.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three companies cite huge developer productivity benefits,
code-reusability, large-scale refactorings and development at scale for
choosing this approach. The Facebook talk even mentions how all their
development infrastructure efforts focus on keeping this workflow because of
the benefits it brings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="downsides-of-having-many-repositories">
<h2>Downsides of having many Repositories</h2>
<p>In contrast working with ever smaller repositories can be a huge burden for
developer mental models: I have seen this in open-source projects such as
Doctrine and several customer projects:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Cross repository changes require certain pull-requests on Github/Gitlab to
be merged in order or in combination yet the tools don&#8217;t provide visibility
into these dependencies. They are purely informal, leading to high error
rates.</li>
<li>Version pinning through NPM and Composer package managers is great for
managing third party dependencies as long its not too many of them and they
don&#8217;t change too often. For internal dependencies its a lot of work to
update dependencies between repositories all the time. Time gets lost by
developers that don&#8217;t have the correct dependencies or because of mistakes
in the merge process.</li>
<li>Changing code in core libraries can break dependencies without the developer
even realizing this because tests don&#8217;t run together. This introduces a
longer feedback cycle between code that depends on each other, with all the
downsides.</li>
</ol>
<p>One important remark about monolithic repositories: It does not automatically
lead to a monolithic code-base. Especially Symfony2 and ZF2 are a very
good example of how you can build individual components with a clean dependency
graph in a single big repository.</p>
<p>At <a class="reference external" href="http://qafoo.com">Qafoo</a> we have always preferred monolithic project
repositories containing several components over many small independent ones. We
advised many customers to choose this approach except in some special cases
where going small was economically more efficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="benefits-of-monolithic-repositories">
<h2>Benefits of Monolithic Repositories</h2>
<p>Even if you are not at the scale of Facebook or Google, a single repository
still provides the mentioned benefits:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Adjusting to constant change by factoring out libraries, merging libraries
and introducing new dependencies for multiple projects is much easier when
done in a single, atomic VCS commit.</li>
<li>Discoverability of code is much higher, if you have all the code in a single
place. Github and Gitlab don&#8217;t offer powerful tools like find, grep, sed over
more than one repository. Hunting down dependencies, in specific versions can
cost alot of time.</li>
<li>Reusability increases as it is much easier to just use code from the same
repository than from another repository. Composer and NPM simplify combining
repositories at specific versions, however one problem is actually knowing
that the code exists in the first place.</li>
<li>From an operational perspective it is much easier to get a new developer
up to speed setting up projects from a single repository. Just practically
its easier to add his public key to only one Team/Repository/Directory than
to hundreds. On top of that setting up many small repositories and
familiarizing with each of them costs a lot of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why I have been struggling with how Packagist and Satis force the move
to smaller repositories through the technical constraint &#8220;one repository equals
one composer.json file&#8221;. For reusable open source projects this is perfectly
fine, but for company projects I have seen it hurt developer productivity more
often than is acceptable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introducing-fiddler">
<h2>Introducing Fiddler</h2>
<p>So today I prototyped a build system that complements Composer to manage
multiple separate projects/packages in a single repository. I call it <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei/fiddler">Fiddler</a>. Fiddler introduces a maintainable
approach to managing dependencies for multiple projects in a single repository,
without losing the benefits of having explicit dependencies for each separate
project.</p>
<p>In practice Fiddler allows you to manage all your third-party dependencies using a
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">composer.json</span></span> file, while adding a new way of managing your internal
dependencies. It combines both external and internal packages to a single
pool and allows you to pick them as dependencies for your projects.</p>
<p>For each project you add a <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fiddler.json</span></span> file where you specify both your
third-party and internal dependencies. Fiddler will take care of generating a
specific autoloader for each project, containing only the dependencies of the
project.  This allows you to have one repository, while still having <em>explicit</em>
dependencies per project.</p>
<p>Keeping explicit dependencies for each project means it&#8217;s still easy to find
out which components are affected by changes in internal or third-party
dependencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-project">
<h2>Example Project</h2>
<p>Say you have three packages in your application, Library_1, Project_A
and Project_B and both projects depend on the library which in turn depends
on <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">symfony/dependency-injection</span></span>. The repository has the following file structure:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>projects
├── components
│   ├── Project_A
│   │   └── fiddler.json
│   ├── Project_B
│   │   └── fiddler.json
│   └── Library_1
│       └── fiddler.json
├── composer.json
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fiddler.json</span></span> of Library_1 looks like this::</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;autoload&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;psr-0&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;Library1</span><span class="se">\\</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;src/&quot;</span><span class="p">}},</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;deps&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;vendor/symfony/dependency-injection&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fiddler.json</span></span> of Project_A and Project_B look similar (except the autoload)::</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;autoload&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;psr-0&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;ProjectA</span><span class="se">\\</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;src/&quot;</span><span class="p">}},</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;deps&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;components/Library_1&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The global <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">composer.json</span></span> as you would expect::</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;require&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;symfony/dependency-injection&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;~2.6&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As you can see dependencies are specified without version constraints and as
directory paths relative to the project root. Since everything is in one
repository, all internal code is always versioned, tested and deployed
together. Dropping the need for explicit versions when specifying internal
dependencies.</p>
<p>With this setup you can now generate the autoloading files for each package
exactly like Composer would by calling:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ php fiddler.phar build
Building fiddler.json projects.
 [Build] components/Library_1
 [Build] components/Project_A
 [Build] components/Project_B
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now in each package you can <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">require</span> <span class="pre">&quot;vendor/autoload.php&quot;;</span></span> and it loads an
autoloader with all the dependencies specified for each component, for example
in <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">components/Library_1/index.php</span></span></p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="k">require_once</span> <span class="s2">&quot;vendor/autoload.php&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="nv">$container</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerBuilder</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is an early access preview, please test this, provide feedback if you see
this as a valuable or not and about possible extensions. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei/fiddler">README</a> for more details about functionality
and implementation details.</p>
<p>The code is very rough and simple right now, you will probably stumble accross
some bugs, please <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei/fiddler/issues">report them</a>.
It is stable enough so that we could actually port <a class="reference external" href="https://tideways.io">Tideways</a> to it already which is a multi package repository.</p>
