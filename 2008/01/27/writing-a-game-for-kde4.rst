Writing a Game for KDE4
=======================

I am writing PHP / Web Applications for about 8 years now, but I am not
so much the pro in writing desktop applications. I know little or no
C/C++/Java, but want to change that soon. Since I use KDE for both my
desktop and laptop it seems reasonable to write a KDE 4 application.

What about idaes? I wanted to write a game for so long and in the last
years my girlfriend and I tried lots of 2 person player games. One of
them I wanted to re-create as a computer game.

The possibilites are:

-  `The Game of the
   Amazons <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Amazons>`_
-  `Moruba <http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Moruba>`_ - Oware or a
   variant.

All 3 games are time intensive and very strategic. Moruba can be played
for lots of hours (My gf and I played one game for about 5-6 hours). Its
propably more easy to write algorithms for the computer player of Oware
or Moruba than for Amazons, but that should not affect my decision. I
will decide in the next weeks, but I should propably concentrate on my
semesters final exams in the first place.

**Update:** Moruba seems to have different rules than the game we are
playing. I will elaborate on that soon.
