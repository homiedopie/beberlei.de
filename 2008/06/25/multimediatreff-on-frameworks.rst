Multimediatreff on Frameworks
=============================

My neighbour gladly called my attention to the
`Multimediatreff <http://www.multimediatreff.de>`_, a relaxed conference
that is held about three times a year, this last saturday on the topic:
Frameworks and Content-Management-Systems.

It was held in a very nice conference center in cologne, and from what I
heard about 200 people attended. The first two topics were on
`Joomla! <http://www.joomla.org/>`_ and barrier-free
`Typo3 <http://www.typo3.org>`_. Since I am more the framework guy, I
did not enjoy them too much. At least I got some input on how a
barrier-free website has to function. The Joomla! presentation supported
my prejudice, that programming in and for Joomla! produces ugly code.

I did like the presentations on frameworks, the most interesting being
the `CakePHP <http://www.cakephp.org>`_ presentation by `Timo
Derstappen <http://teemow.com/>`_, since I haven't looked into Cake for
about one and a half years. I have seen that with the new to come
version 2, the framework became even better, now supporting easy code
generation and flexible site generation. But its still somehow a Ruby
clone and forces me too much in my programming style.

The `Zend Framework <http://framework.zend.com>`_ presentation was done
by Carsten Möhrke, who also wrote the first german ZF Book. He showed
the creation of a blog using Zend Framework, being the Hello World
example for frameworks. He specifically showed, that you can use
anything you want as a model, a Zend\_Db\_Table object or any other
object. He also showed something like a Data-Mapper pattern in his
application. I got some ideas from this I probably will write about some
later time.

I also enjoyed the `Rails <http://www.rubyonrails.de>`_ presentation,
because I never got the chance to look the Ruby guys at work of the
shoulder. But this is even worse than CakePHP was my first observation.
I am no fan of ActiveRecord being forced upon you as Model
implementation.

The pizza battle, mysteriously announced by the host, was another
highlight, as well as the drinks and snacks in between. All in all I can
highly recommend the Multimediatreff for the next time.
