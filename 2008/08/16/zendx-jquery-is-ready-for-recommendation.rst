ZendX_JQuery is Ready for Recommendation
========================================

Yesterday night I finished the `proposal for
ZendX\_JQuery <http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/ZendX_JQuery_View_Helper_JQuery+-+Benjamin+Eberlei>`_,
a View Helper and an Ajax Helper hopefully to be included in the `Zend
Framework <http://framework.zend.com>`_ Extras Library in the next
release after 1.6. I moved the proposal to the "Ready for
Recommendation" section now, so it can be reviewed a last time by the
community and by the Zend people.

For those people already using an earlier version, i have squashed about
4-5 bugs I found writing the Unit-Tests for this component. The test
coverage for both helpers is 100% although the jQLink Helper might need
some additional Use-Case scenarios to ensure proper working. You can
`find the current
version <http://www.beberlei.de/dev/svn/ZendX_JQuery>`_ at my SVN
repository.
