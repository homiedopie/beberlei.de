Encouraging forks for Calypso DTL
=================================

I still get a bunch of emails regarding the `Calypso DTL template
engine <http://www.beberlei.de/calypso>`_ that I have written some month
ago and which i can currently not maintain any further (`see my posting
on that <http://www.whitewashing.de/blog/articles/86>`_). Still I
encourage anyone to fork the project and develop it further. Personally
what I think is missing are some bugfixes and enhancements regarding the
compiling and parsing. I created a `GITHub Project for Calypso
DTL <http://github.com/beberlei/calypsodtl/tree/master>`_, so
collaborative development is very easy and added general TODOS to the
README.txt that is on the front page of github project page.
