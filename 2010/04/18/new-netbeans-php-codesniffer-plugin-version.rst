New Netbeans PHP CodeSniffer Plugin Version
===========================================

This morning I took the time to merge several changes by `Manuel
Piechler <http://manuel-pichler.de/>`_ into `my Github
branch <http://github.com/beberlei/netbeans-php-enhancements>`_ of the
CodeSniffer Plugin and released a new NBM file for you to
`download <http://github.com/beberlei/netbeans-php-enhancements/downloads>`_.
Here are the changes done by Manuel:

-  Ability to specifiy the path to CodeSniffer Binary
-  Automatic Detection of all the installed Coding Standards
-  Fixed Automatic Binary Detection on Windows

The only open TODO for this project is the possibility to specify
different standards on a per project basis, currently you can only
choose a global standard.
