Unslacking Tideways Company
===========================

We have moved away from Slack at Tideways over the last three months, because I
found Slack is already annoying, even with just a four person team (plus the
occasional freelancer). For me, it disrupts deep work phases and knowledge lost
in the depth of chat history. I can't imagine how unproductive Slack must be
for larger companies.

As an engineer, I have learned to be productive when I have a quiet space and
can tinker on a problem without getting interrupted. Slack makes this very
difficult and at least for me, is a primary cause of anxiety and fear of
missing out (FOMO).

While at first sight it seems chat is asynchronous it really is not.

1. If you wait for a long time to reply to a message on chat, then the
   discussion thread is already spread in the history of the chat room and
   messages back and forth interleaved with many additional messages that are
   not related is not helpful.
2. In addition chats online status indicators exist just so that you know
   if someone can answer any question directly, increasing communication
   anxiety.
3. If you set yourself into some kind of do not disturb mode or mute a channel,
   then its easy to miss important conversations and get left out of
   discussions or decisions. Reading up on long conversations you have missed
   is hard with chat tools.
4. By also sending Github commit messages, OpsGenie and Tideways alerts,
   excerpts of HelpScout ticket updates and other "events" of the business into
   Slack through various integrations we made Slack the primary tool to check
   if **anything** is going on. While it is important to see what is going on,
   this almost never has to happen in realtime and by connecting it to the
   chat, we excuberated the previous points and everyone is checking chat even
   more frequently.

Jason Fried summed it up much better than I could `in this blog post
<https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d>`_.

We are now using Github (issues and pull requests) and Basecamp (Messages,
Todolists) to replace Slack. Both tools allow us to have context sensitive,
asynchronous discussions on specific topics.

Since work never happens in a vacuum, I would be happy to have only a
single realtime notification tool (OpsGenie/PagerDuty) that sends notifications
to poeple currently on-call, and only about problems that require realtime
attention. Everything else, including chat, can be part of a daily summary
e-mail or screen.

My ultimate goal is to get longer stretches of uninterrupted time to work on
features, customer support or operational issues. Under time pressure the last
3 years I realized that productive and concentrated tinkering on projects is my
number one driver of happiness at work. I consider this a primary value of the
my company, and it takes hard work to make it happen.
