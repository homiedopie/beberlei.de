Speaking about Framework Quality on the IPC Spring 09
=====================================================

Just a short notice, my thesis is taking its last breath, I will be
speaking on the `IPC Spring 09
conference <http://www.phpconference.com>`_ in Berlin end of may this
year on Framework Quality and Unittests:

    **Framework Quality: Unit-Tests as silent witness**
     Unit-Tests are often overlooked in framework discussions that focus
    on features, performance, tools or database abstraction. However
    they are a silent witness on how poor or well frameworks are
    designed. In this presentation we will look at the testsuites of the
    big players in the PHP framework business - Zend Framework,
    ezComponents, Symfony and CakePHP - and reveal their hidden secrets.

This talk will make heavy use of the `PHP Unittest and Metrics
Aggregator tool <https://github.com/beberlei/puma/tree>`_, which i haven
written on several times. For both CakePHP and Symfony extensions for
their testtools may have to be written.

I am really excited for my first time being speaker on a conference and
looking forward to see you at IPC.
