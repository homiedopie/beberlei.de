Netbeans PHP CodeSniffer Plugin: Now with Options Dialog
========================================================

Just two days before the `International PHP Conference
09 <http://www.phpconference.de>`_ will start I got an email from
`alexandrehaguiar <http://github.com/alexandrehaguiar>`_ that he forked
my Netbeans PHP CodeSniffer plugin and added the long awaited Options
screen. This is just awesome! This way I don't have to ask the Netbeans
guys at IPC all the questions about how to implement it. I merged the
changes back into my branch and released a new version which also fixed
another small bug. For me it works with both Netbeans 6.7.1 and 6.8
Beta. I want to thank alexandre very much for this awesome contribution.

What you can do now is chose the Coding Standard you want to use in an
Options Dialog under the "Miscallenous" button. You can choose from a
list of pre-defined standards, or even enter your own if you use one.
Additionally you can disable that warning are shown, so that with any
given coding standard you only see the errors.

You can download the new version from the `Github Project Downloads
page <http://github.com/beberlei/netbeans-php-enhancements/downloads/>`_.
