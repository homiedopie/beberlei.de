Seven Things
============

I have been tagged by
`Freeaqingme <http://dolfschimmel.freeaqingme.com/?p=78>`_ and the blog
letter machinery. So read on for seven things you probably may not know
about me.

-  I will get my degree in some weeks, currently intensively writting on
   my thesis. My major is economics though. I probably won't get a job
   with that sooner or later. I actually don't want to, I have a job as
   programmer already.
-  One christmas many years ago (Pentium PCs to 200Mhz were the coolest
   thing around) i wished and wished for a computer for playing Command
   and Conquer and stuff. What i got was a 3/86 i could only run crap
   with. So i had to start programming.
-  In 11th grade (7 years ago) I took part in the german computer
   science olympics (`exercise still
   online <http://www.bwinf.de/uploads/media/bwi20/runde1/20bwinf.pdf>`_)
   using PHP and writing thousands of lines of nested aray and for loop
   code and print the solution to the browser. No need to say I utterly
   failed, because I didn't know a bit about algorithms, pointers and
   objects at all.
-  I have only learned about what good programming practices are (OO,
   functional, whatever) really means in the last two years, spending
   almost every free minute of those many i had on projects to test
   around with patterns and programming styles.
-  I went to my first conference last year september, the IPC in Mainz,
   getting to know lots of great people in the community.
-  I don't have a license at all (`Reference to
   Sara <http://blog.libssh2.org/index.php?/archives/122-Seven-Things.html>`_).
   I am afraid of driving cars, although I drive my bike through the
   biggest crossroads in town like nuts.
-  I am a timeline oriented reader, having made me masterplans to read
   both all the Discworld and Ian Rankin novels in the correct order to
   not miss a single reference.

Its sad that everyone I would want to tag was already tagged by someone
else, still for the head count:

-  `Matthew Weierophinney <http://weierophinney.net/matthew/>`_, because
   he helped me understand Zend Framework alot.
-  `Ben Scholzen <http://www.dasprids.de/>`_, because he is a fun guy to
   be around **#zftalk.dev**.
-  `Thomas Weidner <http://www.thomasweidner.com/flatpress/>`_, because
   I like his dedication towards his ZF components.
-  `Kore Nordmann <http://kore-nordmann.de/blog.html>`_, Bastian Feder
   and Thomas Weinert, because I had great discussions with him on IPC.
-  `zomg aka Jani <http://codeutopia.net/blog/>`_ because of his skills
   to be referenced by PHPDeveloper.org (joke) and the good IRC
   discussions.
-  `Petr Pisl <http://blogs.sun.com/netbeansphp/>`_ because of the
   awesome NetBeans PHP support.
