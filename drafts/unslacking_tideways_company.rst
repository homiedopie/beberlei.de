Unslacking Tideways Company
===========================

We have moved away from Slack in the last three months at Tideways, because
even with just a four person plus some freelancers team, its constant need to
put notifications in my face are just plain annoying.

As an engineer, I have learned to be most productive when I have a quiet
space and can tinker on a problem without getting interrupted. Slack
doesn't allow this.

While at first sight it seems chat is asynchroneous it really is not. If you
wait for a long time to reply to a message on chat, then it is already "lost"
in the history of the chat room and messages back and forth interleaved with
many additional messages that are not related is not helpful. In addition chats
online status indicators suggests that you can answer any question. If you set
yourself into some kind of do not disturb mode or mute a channel, then its easy
to miss important conversations and get left out of decisions.

In addition we previously sent Github commit messages, OpsGenie and Tideways
alerts, HelpScout support ticket updates and other "events" of the business
into Slack through various integrations. While it is important to see what is
going on, it almost never has to happen in realtime.
