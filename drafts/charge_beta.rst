In retrospect there was one additional factor that helped make Tideways a
success for various reasons: I never gave Tideways away for free. Beta
customers had access to a 30 days trial and were required to sign up to a paid
plan afterwards. I took this advice from Travis CI CEO Matthias Meyer who wrote
on `Why you should charge for your beta product
<http://www.paperplanes.de/2014/2/18/why-you-should-charge-for-your-beta-product.html>`_.
  
- This decision provided the project with early revenue to pay for essentials such as hosting and
  third party services. For a bootstrapped project this is very important, I
  would not want to spend 1000â‚¬/month out of my own pockect on a side project
  that has not yet proven successful.

- It gave me the validation that people are willing to pay money for this.
  
- Since Tideways only had 3-6 paying customers for the first few month till
  public launch, it kept the required server resources low und allowed me to
  work on features and not scaling.

It is incredibly scary to charge for a beta product that looks unfinished,
still uses a default Bootstrap theme and requires more setup steps than the
opening of a bank account. But if you don't do it early, you can fall in the
trap of postponing the launch date over and over again. 

Not charging in the beginning also creates a problem on launch date. You either
have to scare away all your free customers by forcing payments on them or you
keep a free plan. Keeping a free plan is a problem for a bootstrapped business,
because it can require considerable resources (support, hosting) that you
probably cannot provide.

So there are some new lessons learned:

- Don't give your product away for free
- Don't be scared charging for a beta product
