<h1><a href="2008/05/07/zend-form-rapid-development-plugin-for-eclipse.html">Zend_Form - Rapid Development Plugin for Eclipse?</a></h1>
<p>I found some time in the last weeks to reconsider <a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend
Framework</a>, this time in the 1.5 version,
for this blog software and rewrote all Forms using the new Zend_Form
component. I have to say, i love it. Its very easy using the already
existing Zend_Validate and Zend_Filter components as input for the
generated form fields. Another plus is the handling of errors in input
and re-entering/displaying text.</p>
<p>There is also a neat feature of the Zend_Form component, which allows
to <a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.quickstart.html#zend.form.quickstart.config">generate complete forms by passing an appropriately formatted
Zend_Config_Ini object to the Zend_Form
Constructor</a>.
So my idea was, why not program an Eclipse Plugin allowing to rapidly
generate and edit forms using a point-and-click plugin window approach,
which would ultimately generate your Form INI code.</p>
<p>This might have been a great <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code
idea</a> for the Eclipse Foundation (since
Zend is not taking part).</p>

<h1><a href="2008/06/30/implementing-zend-auth-acl-and-caching.html">Implementing Zend Auth, Acl and Caching</a></h1>
<p>I managed to work a bit on the blog, enabling me to have new instance in
the series, How to refactor and extend your own blog software using
<a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a>. This time: Implementing
meaningful Auth and ACL mechanisms and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.whitewashing.de/blog/articles/41">fixing view
caching</a>, which did not
work in its original implementation due to different users groups
sharing the same cached views.</p>
<p>In the last days I came across two in depth tutorials on Zend_Acl and
Zend_Auth integration to MVC. Most people probably saw the DevZone
article “<a class="reference external" href="http://devzone.zend.com/article/3509-Zend_Acl-and-MVC-Integration-Part-I-Basic-Use">Zend_Acl and MVC Integration (part
1)</a>”
by Aldemar Bernal on the Frameworks Frontpage. Another good article was
written by Frank Ruske in the latest german <a class="reference external" href="http://www.phpmagazin.de">PHP
Magazin</a> (<a class="reference external" href="http://it-republik.de/zonen/magazine/ausgaben/psfile/source_file/14/Seite_80__482a98c572a5c.zip">Zipped Source Code of the
Example</a>).
I took the best ideas of both articles and merged them into the existing
components of my blog.</p>
<p>This now enables me to cache the site depending on the Auth status of
the page user agent. The blog is now caching all views that are
generated for guest users. Since there is no “registered” or “member”
account yet, this means the blogs content is cached and served from
cache for everyone except me when I am logged in. To get this work I
added some simple additional check in <a class="reference external" href="http://devzone.zend.com/article/3372-Front-Controller-Plugins-in-Zend-Framework">Matthews Cache View Controller
Plugin</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>public function dispatchLoopStartup(Zend_Controller_Request_Abstract $request)
{
    $auth = Zend_Auth::getInstance();
    if($auth-&gt;hasIdentity()) {
        self::$doNotCache = true;
        return;
    }
    [..]
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This prevents caching for registered identities.</p>

<h1><a href="2008/06/14/exim4-and-virtual-users-forward-files.html">Exim4 and Virtual Users .forward Files</a></h1>
<p>Some days ago I began to wonder why some mails in mail account were
filtered by Exims .forward file why some are not. It took until today
that I found out what was the problem and how to fix it.</p>
<p>I implemented a virtual users/domains system for Exim using several
different documentations and tutorials. Right now some parts of my
system include the documentation on</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.tty1.net/virtual_domains_en.html">http://www.tty1.net/virtual_domains_en.html</a></p>
<p>Now the problem is that the userforward router is only working for
accounts whose $local_part is an existing system user. I came up with
the following additional router that solves the problem. Its written for
the MySQL table layout that is specified in the Tutorial above.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>virtualuserforward:
  debug_print = &quot;R: virtualuserforward for $local_part@$domain&quot;
  driver = redirect
  domains = +local_domains
  file = ${lookup mysql{SELECT CONCAT(home,'.forward') AS forward FROM users \
        WHERE id='${quote_mysql:$local_part}@${quote_mysql:$domain}'}}
  no_verify
  no_expn
  check_ancestor
  directory_transport = address_directory
  file_transport = address_file
  pipe_transport = address_pipe
  reply_transport = address_reply
  allow_filter

  user = ${lookup mysql{SELECT uid FROM users \
        WHERE id='${quote_mysql:$local_part}@${quote_mysql:$domain}'}}
  group = ${lookup mysql{SELECT gid FROM users \
        WHERE id = '${quote_mysql:$local_part}@${quote_mysql:$domain}'}}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now each virtual user is using the .forward file in its actual system
user account home directory. The next problem was: $home is not defined
in this case in the .forward file syntax: Its empty. So replacing $home
with its obvious path leads to the final solution.</p>

<h1><a href="2008/06/25/multimediatreff-on-frameworks.html">Multimediatreff on Frameworks</a></h1>
<p>My neighbour gladly called my attention to the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.multimediatreff.de">Multimediatreff</a>, a relaxed conference
that is held about three times a year, this last saturday on the topic:
Frameworks and Content-Management-Systems.</p>
<p>It was held in a very nice conference center in cologne, and from what I
heard about 200 people attended. The first two topics were on
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla!</a> and barrier-free
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.typo3.org">Typo3</a>. Since I am more the framework guy, I
did not enjoy them too much. At least I got some input on how a
barrier-free website has to function. The Joomla! presentation supported
my prejudice, that programming in and for Joomla! produces ugly code.</p>
<p>I did like the presentations on frameworks, the most interesting being
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> presentation by <a class="reference external" href="http://teemow.com/">Timo
Derstappen</a>, since I haven’t looked into Cake for
about one and a half years. I have seen that with the new to come
version 2, the framework became even better, now supporting easy code
generation and flexible site generation. But its still somehow a Ruby
clone and forces me too much in my programming style.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a> presentation was done
by Carsten Möhrke, who also wrote the first german ZF Book. He showed
the creation of a blog using Zend Framework, being the Hello World
example for frameworks. He specifically showed, that you can use
anything you want as a model, a Zend_Db_Table object or any other
object. He also showed something like a Data-Mapper pattern in his
application. I got some ideas from this I probably will write about some
later time.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rubyonrails.de">Rails</a> presentation,
because I never got the chance to look the Ruby guys at work of the
shoulder. But this is even worse than CakePHP was my first observation.
I am no fan of ActiveRecord being forced upon you as Model
implementation.</p>
<p>The pizza battle, mysteriously announced by the host, was another
highlight, as well as the drinks and snacks in between. All in all I can
highly recommend the Multimediatreff for the next time.</p>

<h1><a href="2008/06/22/zf-caching-pages-via-front-controller-plugin.html">ZF: Caching Pages via Front Controller Plugin</a></h1>
<p>Today I implemented caching using a front controller plugin (<a class="reference external" href="http://devzone.zend.com/article/3372">see
Matthews post on Zend Devzone</a>)
into the Whitewashing blog software via Zend_Cache and the Filesystem
Backend. I ran some superficial Apache Benchmark tests to have a look
at the gain change in performance.</p>
<p>First of all i used the complete Plugin from <a class="reference external" href="http://devzone.zend.com/article/3372">Matthews article on Zend
Devzone</a> and a missing function
getCache() in the code fragment:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>public function getCache()
{
    if( ($response = $this-&gt;cache-&gt;load($this-&gt;key)) != false) {
        return $response;
    }
    return false;
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I loaded the Plugin into the front controller and initialized it with a
Zend_Config_Ini object. This all works very smoothly and caching is
ready to begin.</p>
<p>Testing came to the result that with 1000 requests, 10 of them concurrent
(ab -n 1000 -c 10), which I know is a rather unrealistic assumption for
this blog, the request time dropped by half, from six to three seconds
(still lot of time, but this isn’t the best webserver).</p>
<div class="section" id="results-without-caching">
<h2>Results without caching</h2>

</div>
<p>As said before this testing is superficial, but its gives a broad sense
of what performance gain is possible with just some lines of code and a
temporary directory. Using memcache will probably speed up the process
another good amount.</p>
<p>Later I realized that complete page caching (rather than block element
caching) sucks when you inject admin area links into the navigation,
which would allow non-logged in users to see parts of the admin area so
I had to disable caching totally. You never know in the first place (you
should though). I have to rework my admin area or extend my
authentication or the caching plugin somehow. This will probably be the
topic another time.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.zend.com">Zend</a> announced they work together with the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org">Dojo Team</a> to integrate Javascript
support into the Zend Framework. What this actually means is that you
can write your Javascript Code in PHP if you’re javascript library of
choice is Dojo.</p>
<p>Since Dojo is not my library of choice I would have to write a JQuery
View Helper on my own or wait until somebody else releases one.</p>
<p>But why not write javascript? Its very easy with all those libraries and
addresses most cross browser incompatibilities: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2006/jul/02/django-and-ajax/">One
Django</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.builtfromsource.com/2006/12/20/does-ajax-have-a-place-in-the-application-framework/">one Zend Framework
developer</a>
argue framework and javascript coupling is not the way to go based on
the arguments that its breaks the MVC pattern, leads to function calls
equal to those in javascript in its framework respective language, and
that javascript is actually something any good webdeveloper should be
able to program, even when its just using library components.</p>
<p>Using <a class="reference external" href="http://jquery.com">JQuery</a> without any help from tools for
about a year now I can say there are still those days where javascript
drives me mad, but most of the time I its working perfect. Since Ajax
related calls like GET, POST, and FORM stuff are oneliners I don’t see
why one would need tighter integration of JS and frameworks.</p>
<p>Larger Javascript components like Popup Calendars, Autocomplete and the
like are harder to integrate than in Rails or cakePHP, but thinking
about the problem a little longer leads to powerful reusable solutions,
that save time on integration after the first initial setup.</p>

<h1><a href="2008/06/21/simplifying-zf-scope-of-variables-in-view-and-controller.html">Simplifying ZF: Scope of Variables in View and Controller</a></h1>
<p>As a follow up on the <a class="reference external" href="http://destiney.com/blog/zend-framework-web-2-0-framework-my-ass">Zend Framework, “Web 2.0 Framework” My
Ass!</a>
article referenced earlier I came up with some simplifications of the Zend
View and Controller variable coupling.</p>
<p>Using some code in the article I created a new Zend_View_Extended
class which offers the possibility to circumvent the access of variables
via $this and directly registers each variable key of the Zend_View
object as an own variable in the script template:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>class Zend_View_Extended extends Zend_View_Abstract
{
    protected function _run()
    {
        while( list( $k, $v ) = each( $this ) ) ${$k} = $v;

        include func_get_arg(0);
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now rather than calling $this-&gt;data you can call $data in a script
template. Of course this comes with additional overhead of each variable
being registered twice. I don’t know how this handles performance wise,
but maybe unsetting $this variables after copying solves this. Also you
have to overwrite the initView() method of your base Controller Action
class.</p>
<p>Another simplification would be to allow for the following direct
variable settings in any Controller Action, which would shorten the
$this-&gt;view-&gt;variable call, to derive the same functionality via
$this-&gt;variable. I haven’t tested this though.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>class Zend_Controller_SimpleAction extends Zend_Controller_Action
{
    function __set($name, $value)

<h1><a href="2008/06/24/teaching-zend-form-some-mvc.html">Teaching Zend_Form some MVC</a></h1>
<p>Lots of people complain that Zend Form runs counter to the MVC spirit,
because it handles validation, business logic and view elements all in
one acting as Model, Controller and View.</p>
<p>Extending the Zend Form component to handle all this different aspects
in different layers of the application is rather easy though. What we
want of a MVC compatible Form object is the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <strong>model</strong> escapes and validates all the data that is put into the
form.</li>
<li>The <strong>view</strong> decides on how the form is displayed.</li>
<li>The <strong>controller</strong> moves data from the model to the view and back,
handling the stages of the form request.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step is, <strong>allowing any Model that implements
Zend_Validator_Interface to hook into the Zend_Form Validation
process</strong>. We generate a new class, WW_Form_Mvc and allow a function
setModel() to insert any Model object that implements
Zend_Validator_Interface into the form. We extend isValid(),
getMessages() and getErrors() to not only check all the form elements
validators, but also the models validators. Please note that the
array_merge() solution is not the correct way of how this snippet
should work. Any merge operation of the messages and errors has to be on
a field key level, which is not currently done.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>class WW_Form_Mvc extends Zend_Form
{
    protected $model = null;

    /**
     * Extends isValid() method of Zend Form to check for validity of specified model
     * @param Array $data
     * @return Boolean
     */
    public function isValid($data)
    {
        $valid = parent::isValid($data);

        if($valid == true &amp;&amp; !is_null($model)) {
            $valid = $this-&gt;model-&gt;isValid($data) &amp;&amp; $valid;
        }
        return $valid;
    }

    /**
     * Extends getMessages() Validator Interface implementation of Zend Form to also
     * return the messages of the Model validation.
     * @return Array
     */
    public function getMessages($name = null, $suppressArrayNotation = false)
    {
        $messages = parent::getMessages($name, $suppressArrayNotation);

        if(!is_null($model)) {
             $form_messages = $this-&gt;model-&gt;getMessages();

             $messages = array_merge($messages, $form_messages);
        }

        return $messages;
    }

    /**
     * Extends getErrors() Validator Interface implementation of Zend Form to also
     * return the errors of the Model validation.
     * @return Array
     */
    public function getErrors($name = null)
    {
         $messages = parent::getErrors($name);

        if(!is_null($model)) {
             $form_messages = $this-&gt;model-&gt;getErrors();

             $messages = array_merge($messages, $form_messages);
        }

        return $messages;
    }

    /**
     * Set a Model object, which has to implement Zend_Validate_Interface
     * @throws Zend_Exception
     */
    public function setModel($model)
    {
        if($model instanceof Zend_Validate_Interface) {
            $this-&gt;model = $model;
        } else {
             throw new Zend_Exception('WW_Form_Mvc expects a model of type Zend_Validate_Interface');
        }
    }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>We then extend the WW_Form_Mvc class to disable the automatic
loading of decorators in the Constructor and additionally allow to
pass a Model to the constructor as second argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>class WW_Form_Mvc
{
    protected $model = null;

    /**
     * this overrides the original Zend_Form Constructor and skips
     * the decorator initialisation, because this is now being handled
     * by View Helpers
     */
    public function __construct($options=null, $model=null)
    {
        if (is_array($options)) {
            $this-&gt;setOptions($options);
        } elseif ($options instanceof Zend_Config) {
            $this-&gt;setConfig($options);
        }

        // Extensions...
        $this-&gt;init();

        if(!is_null($model)) {
             $this-&gt;setModel($model);
        }
    }

    // All the other stuff here
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In our views we want to <strong>use helper methods to manage the
displaying of the form</strong>. For each different style of form
displaying, we can generate different helpers. For example a helper
that would only apply the default decorators would look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>class WW_View_Helper_FormDefault
{
    /**
     * Load only default decorators on this Zend_Form object
     *
     * @param Zend_Form $form
     */
    public function formDefault(Zend_Form $form)
    {
        if($form instanceof Zend_Form) {
            $form-&gt;loadDefaultDecorators();
            return $form;
        }
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We can now use this helper and in any template say: &lt;?=
$this-&gt;formDefault($this-&gt;someForm); ?&gt; We can now look at our
controller action that implements this form and we will see that it
does not look different from what we would have done before:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>function formAction()
{
    $model = new SomeModel();

    $form = new WW_Form_Mvc();
    $form-&gt;setModel($model);

    // generate form here, adding elements and stuff

    if($form-&gt;isValid($_POST)) {
        $model-&gt;insert($form-&gt;getValues());
        $this-&gt;view-&gt;form = &quot;Form was submitted!&quot;;
    } else {
        $this-&gt;view-&gt;form = $form;
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Isnt that nice? Now each part of the equation is doing what its
supposed to do.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<h1><a href="2008/11/05/overwrite-ezcmvccontroller-a-bit-more-rapid.html">Overwrite ezcMvcController - A bit more rapid</a></h1>
<p>ezComponents gets Mvc in its 2008.2 version. I have played around a bit
with the alpha version, since I am currently searching for a good
framework for a high performance application. My first benchmarks on
ezcMvc just say: wh000pie! A lot faster as compared to the Zend
Framework.
Still ezcMvc is VERY loosely coupled and you have to write lots of lines
to get where ZF gets you with less (more magic involved). As you can see
from the <a class="reference external" href="http://ezcomponents.org/docs/tutorials/MvcTools#creating-the-controller">tutorial on the ezcMvcTools
component</a>
it is currently a bit unwieldily to work with ezcMvcController since you
have to create and return result objects everywhere. This is very nice
since it abstracts from the actual response type (could be www, mail,
cli, anything).
I have created a very little extension of the ezcMvcController class
that hopefully serves you quite some time. You can append variables to
the ezcMvcResult object by calling the magic __get and __set on the
controller. Plus it offers a method to use the ezcMvcInternalRedirect
instead of the result. See for yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>class myController extends ezcMvcController
{
    protected $result;

    public function createResult()
    {
        $actionMethod = $this-&gt;createActionMethodName();

        if ( method_exists( $this, $actionMethod ) ) {
            $status = $this-&gt;$actionMethod();
            if($status != 0) {
                $this-&gt;getResult()-&gt;status = $status;
            }
            return $this-&gt;getResult();
        } else {
            throw new ezcMvcActionNotFoundException( $this-&gt;action );
        }
    }

    protected function _redirect($uri)
    {
        $request = clone $this-&gt;request;
        $request-&gt;uri = $uri;
        $this-&gt;result = new ezcMvcInternalRedirect($request);
    }

    public function __get($name)
    {
        if(isset($this-&gt;getResult()-&gt;variables[$name])) {
            return $this-&gt;getResult()-&gt;variables[$name];
        }
        return null;
    }

    public function __set($name, $value)
    {
        $this-&gt;getResult()-&gt;variables[$name] = $value;
    }

    public function __isset($name)
    {
        return isset($this-&gt;getResult()-&gt;variables[$name]);
    }

    protected function getResult()
    {
        if($this-&gt;result === null) {
            $this-&gt;result = new ezcMvcResult();
        }
        return $this-&gt;result;
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You can now use a controller in the following way:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>class dashboardController extends myController
{
    public function doIndex()
    {
        $this-&gt;cookie = &quot;Cookie!&quot;; // Proxy to $ezcMvcResult-&gt;variables['cookie']
    }

    public function doRedirect()
    {
        $this-&gt;_redirect(&quot;/&quot;);
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Very nice! The next thing I have to extend in ezcMvc is automagical
matching of controller and action names to view output names with a
special View Handler that takes care of this. This saves another bunch
of work you have to cope with in the current standard setup.</p>

<p>In the next days the next mini release of the Zend Framework will be
released and I want to keep you up to date of my progress on it.
I got lots of feedback on the jQuery component and also had the
possibility to fix some bugs and documentation issues. I also fixed some
minor bugs that have been in the Zend_Soap_Wsdl stuff i added for the
1.7 release.
And a question for the 1.8 release that is due around February 2009:
What do you think is missing in the jQuery support to ZF? Any widgets or
stuff that you want to have included?</p>
