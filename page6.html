            <h1><a href="2013/06/24/bounded_contexts.html">Bounded Contexts</a></h1>
<p>I regularly fall into the same trap when building applications: Trying to find
the one model that unifies all the use-cases and allows to solve every problem.
From discussions with other developers I know not to be the only one making this
mistake.</p>
<p>It is propably a human trait trying to find the one line that connects
every dot. However in software design there is a case to be made for the
separation of contexts to tackle complexity. Eric Evans described this in detail with the
<a class="reference external" href="http://dddcommunity.org/uncategorized/bounded-context/">“Bounded Context”</a> pattern in his
“Domain-Driven Design” book. According to an interview with Evans I read
somewhere, he considers it one of the most important patterns in the whole book.</p>
<p>The essence of this strategic pattern is to embrance the separation of
different parts of an application and develop different models as different
domain contexts. Consistency and constraints are enforced within one context,
but don’t necessarily hold in another context.</p>
<p>The goal is simplication and freeing us from the burden of finding that one
model that fits all use cases. It is much less awkward to have some parts of
the model reimplemented for different purposes than creating God objects that
try to unify everything, and failing at this task.</p>
<p>Evans goes even further and introduces a significant amount of patterns
that describe the relationship between different bounded contexts.</p>
<div class="section" id="an-experiment">
<h2>An Experiment</h2>
<p>At the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.socrates-conference.de/">SoCraTes conference</a> in August
last year, I participated in a DDD architecture game by <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/cyriux">Cyrille Martraire</a> that focused on distilling bounded contexts. We
were given a very simple domain concept “Customer” and assigned different roles
in the business.</p>
<p>Everyone described their perfect customer very differently, imagining the
Customer object that fits all these requirements was quite an eye opener. Even
if there is no such single software that operates a business, going to the
extreme and defining 10 different angles for a single concept made me clear,
that sometimes different overlapping implementations are not such a bad thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="problems-and-solutions">
<h2>Problems and Solutions</h2>
<p>One problem when applying bounded contexts is data synchronization.
Synchronization between contexts can be reached in many different ways,
three of which are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/DomainEvent.html">Domain Event</a> pattern that integrates
nicelly into Domain-Driven Design and simplifies the synchronization with
other parts of an application.</li>
<li>Correlation Ids of the same entity into the different contexts and a clean
seperation of the data (no shared data necessary).</li>
<li>Another way are immutable read models (value objects) of the data managed in
another context (entity).</li>
</ol>
<p>In any way relying on <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">Eventual
Consistency</a> helps
solving the synchronization problem.</p>
<p>Depending on how your bounded contexts seperate from each other, duplication of
classes is necessary as well. This is something that has to be accounted for
and you should make sure that only one context is responsible for changing the
same data. Different contexts can have different behaviors on the same data.
This is actually a point where Domain-Driven Design and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.whitewashing.de/2012/08/16/oop_business_applications__data__context__interaction.html">Data, Context and
Interaction (DCI)</a>
intersect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Applying bounded contexts to an application or a cluster of applications helps
developers and domain experts to focus on problems in their specific context.
Sometimes each context even has its own domain-expert. The benefit for
developers is a simplified abstraction of different parts of the modelled
problem.</p>

            <h1><a href="2013/05/23/symfony2_on_windows_azure_websites.html">Symfony2 on Windows Azure Websites</a></h1>
<p>With the Windows Azure Websites platform-as-a-service (PaaS), which was
released as a preview to a general audiance in June last year, PHP applications
can be deployed to Azure with as much as a Git push to a remote repository. At
the same time Microsoft released a new and much improved <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-sdk-for-php">PHP SDK</a>, which
integrates with all the Azure webservices.</p>
<p>I blogged about deployment with Composer on Azure Websites last November and
since then I have been working with Microsoft to improve Symfony2 support on
Windows Azure by developing and releasing the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei/AzureDistributionBundle">AzureDistributionBundle</a>. This is a new version
of the bundle and contains the following improvements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Full support for the PHP SDK through the DependencyInjection container</li>
<li>Installation of project dependendencies using Composer during deployment.
I will blog about the Composer support in much more detail in the next
days, because this information is not only valuable for Symfony2 projects.</li>
<li>a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei/symfony-azure-edition">full demo application</a> (derived from
symfony-standard) to show PHP, Symfony &amp; Azure integration</li>
<li>documentation of the Windows Azure Websites deployment process and
possiblities for PHP configuration</li>
<li>a Stream Wrapper for Azure Blob Storage, currently being reviewed for
inclusion into the Azure PHP SDK itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can install both the Bundle or the Demo application via Composer.
For the Demo application call:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ php composer.phar create-project beberlei/symfony-azure-edition
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The README includes more information about how to deploy the demo
to your Azure websites account.</p>
<p>The bundle can be installed using the following <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">composer.json</span></span>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">"require"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s2">"beberlei/azure-distribution-bundle"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"*"</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="s2">"repositories"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="s2">"type"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"pear"</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="s2">"url"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"http://pear.php.net"</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">],</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Registering PEAR is necessary, because the Azure PHP SDK depends on some PEAR
components.</p>

            <h1><a href="2013/04/12/traits_are_static_access.html">Traits are Static Access</a></h1>
<p>In a Twitter discussion yesterday I formulated my negative opinion
about traits and Matthew asked me to clarify it:</p>
<img alt="http://www.whitewashing.de/_static/traits_are_static_access.png" src="http://www.whitewashing.de/_static/traits_are_static_access.png"/>
<p>I used to look forward to traits as a feature in PHP 5.4, but after discussions
with <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/koredn">Kore</a> I came to the conclusion that traits
are nothing else than static access in disguise. They actually lead to the
exact same code smells. Familiar with the outcome of too much static use,
we should reject traits as just another way of statically coupling your code
to other classes.</p>
<p>Let’s step back and take a look at the code smells that Static code produces:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Tight coupling, no way to exchange at runtime</li>
<li>Not mockable</li>
<li>Static code cannot be overwritten through inheritance</li>
<li>Global state (increases likelihood of unwanted side effects)</li>
</ul>
<p>This blog post shows that Traits actually have the first three problems
themselves and exhibit the same code smells. But they even have some additional
problems on their own:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Not testable in isolation</li>
<li>Theoretically stateless, but not enforced in PHP</li>
<li>Very high impact on the code base (Code-Rank)</li>
</ul>
<p>Take the following code, which tries to implement reusable
controller code through traits:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyController</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">use</span> <span class="nx">Redirector</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">protected</span> <span class="nv">$container</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">__construct</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$container</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">container</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$container</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">someAction</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">redirect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"route_xyz"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">array</span><span class="p">());</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">trait</span> <span class="nx">Redirector</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">redirect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$routeName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$parameters</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">RedirectResponse</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">generateUrl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$routeName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$parameters</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">generateUrl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$routeName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$parameters</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">container</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'router'</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">generateUrl</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="nv">$routeName</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="nv">$parameters</span>
        <span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Lets spot the problems:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Redirector</span></span> is tightly coupled to <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MyController</span></span>. There is no way to
change this during runtime, by using a different type of redirector, it has
to be exactly the trait used at compile time. This is exactly what static
access enforces as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The trait accesses <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$this-&gt;container</span></span> without defining it and couples itself against
the implementing classes. We can actually refactor this to include an
abstract method <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getContainer()</span></span> in the trait. But if we have multiple
traits now, all having a <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getContainer()</span></span> method then we run into method
class problems that cannot be solved. We could pass the container as an
argument to the method, but that actually defeats the purpose of the
abstraction here.</p>
<p>Traits using state of their “parents” usually create bidirectional
coupling between classes, something which should be avoided for good
software design.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">No way to overwrite subset of functionality. If I want to use only one
method of a trait and a second one slighty different, then I cannot
overwrite this function of <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Redirector</span></span> for example in <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MyController</span></span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I cannot mock the traits functionality, therefore I cannot test
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MyController</span></span> as a unit only in combination with a trait.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I cannot test the trait as a unit, I always have to create a class
that uses the trait to be able to write a test for it.
This prevents me from testing traits in isolation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Once you start using <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Redirector</span></span> in many controllers, its impact
on your code base (see <a class="reference external" href="http://pdepend.org/documentation/software-metrics/index.html">Code Rank</a>) increases
a lot. Traits are concrete implementations and therefore violate the
Dependency Inversion SOLID principle: Changes in the trait require adoptions
in all the implementing classes.</p>
<p>With aggregation you could depend on an abstraction <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Redirector</span></span> or
turn it into an abstraction in the moment that you need different
functionality.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The discovery of this properties of traits me to the conclusion that traits are
just static access in disguise.</p>
<p>To see this argument a bit more drastically, you can “rewrite” a PHP 5.4 trait
into “pseudo” static code:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyController</span>
<span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">__construct</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$container</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">container</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$container</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">someAction</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">Redirector</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="na">redirect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"route_xyz"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">array</span><span class="p">());</span>

            <span class="nx">self</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="na">generateUrl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$routeName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$parameters</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">generateUrl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$routeName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$parameters</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Calling dynamic methods statically actually works right now (and access to
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$this</span></span> of the parent class will luckily be removed in PHP 5.5). Let’s
reformulate it into something that is actually using static methods and
will work on 5.5, requires changes to the visibility of properties though:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<p>Can you see the familiarity? If Traits can be rewritten as calls to static methods,
how can they be any better than static methods? They exhibit the exact same
problems and produce the same code smells.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Traits should be avoided at all costs, just like static methods.</p>
<p>Rule of Thumb: If you want to use a trait, try to think how to solve the
problem with aggregation.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about problems with traits,

            <h1><a href="2013/04/06/a_failed_side_project.html">Lessons learned: A failed side project</a></h1>
<p>Side projects have always been an important part of how I learn new skills and
technologies. This usually ends with me dumping some prototype on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei?tab=repositories">Github</a>, sometimes even with an open
source project that I commit to maintain over a long time.</p>
<p>Two years ago, for the first time, I pursued a project idea which should
not be open-source but a commercial SAAS product. It grew out of the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.doctrine-project.org">Doctrine</a> teams desire to synchronize
Github Pull Requests with our Jira instance: A workflow engine for HTTP
services. <a class="reference external" href="https://ifttt.com/">If this, then that (IFTTT)</a> already existed at
that point, but was far too limited for my use-case. I wanted something to
allow:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Accept a Github Pull Request Event</li>
<li>Open a Jira Ticket</li>
<li>Comment back on the Pull Request with a link to the Pull Request</li>
<li>Optionally mention that the Pull Request should be made to master, instead of
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$BRANCH</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>I started developing this in my free time based on PHP, Symfony2, CouchDB,
PostgreSQL and Backbone.js and got a prototype working early. However
instead of reaching the state where I could release the project to others I
hit some hurdles:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The project had a UI where you could add/remove and reconnect tasks through
a graphical workflow editor. The javascript became very messy fast, because
I didn’t understand Backbone fully and also didn’t know patterns for
decoupling and testing Javascript code.</li>
<li>I had to restart with the core domain service side code, because I based it
on the Zeta Components workflow library and it was too unflexible for my
special requirements, messing the code up.</li>
<li>I wanted to implement way too many features and had a huge backlog of
issues to implement before “beta”.</li>
</ol>
<p>Last year in July, when I finally had something remotely usable <a class="reference external" href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> hit the market with a beautiful product and support
for gazillions of services. At that point my service just had support for
Github, Twitter and Jira and for generic HTTP POST requests and a UI that
could not be operated by anyone else but me. I was quite demotivated
that day I found out about Zapier.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I continued to work on the project and tried to make it even more
powerful than Zapier, by introducing more features that neither IFTTT nor
Zapier had. Adding this complexity ended up being the nail into the coffin of
the project.</p>
<p>Each week I worked less and less on the project, because I couldn’t find the
motivation. When Zapier got funded in October I was both sad and happy:
Apparently my idea was a good one, however somebody else executed this idea
much better than myself. I stopped working on the project that week.</p>
<p>Today I took the day to migrate the Doctrine Pull Request workflow to a
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei/githubpr_to_jira">simple hardcoded application</a>
and disabled my projects website entirely.</p>
<p>I want to use this moment to share my personal lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Choosing a scope that allows you to finish a working prototype within 1-2 months
is an important key to success.</p>
<p>The longer it takes to get something working and useable for others, the less
motivation you have. I know from my open-source experience that people using your project
is a huge motivation boost.</p>
<p>The side projects I started since last October are much smaller in scope.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You can actually get burned out by a side project: by designing its scope
way too big.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You cannot compete feature-wise with startups that put their full attention into
a project from morning to night. Either make something small working better
than commercial products or quit your job and put your full time into this.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Side projects are either about learning new technologies or about trying
to build something commercially successful. Don’t try to combine this or
you might get frustrated by choosing the wrong technology for the job.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Never ever use an existing open-source library as the core of your
complicated business domain. If your domain is something remotely interesting
you will fail to achieve your goals with the restrictions of the library.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Starting a big project alone is not a good idea. I found out that
discussing ideas with people is very valuable and at the point where I
started sharing my idea with others I was already too far into the project
to be able to take most of the advice into account.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Keeping a project idea secret is completely useless. Others will come up with the
same idea regardless. People have ideas all the day, however nobody ever has
time to implement them. When they do, execution is even more important than
the idea itself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What are your lessons learned from failed side projects? I would be happy to
hear other stories.</p>

            <h1><a href="2013/03/12/code_coffee_bonn.html">Code &amp; Coffee Bonn</a></h1>
<p>On last years <a class="reference external" href="http://www.socrates-conference.de/">SoCraTes Conference</a> I had
the pleasure to meet <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/sandromancuso">Sandro Mancuso</a> from
the London Software Craftsmanship Community (LSCC). Following his Twitter
account I stumbled upon a meetup concept called “Code &amp; Coffee” which the LSCC
organizes very regularly. At a “Code &amp; Coffee” developers would meet up early
in the morning before work to discuss and hack at some coffee place.</p>
<p>I liked the idea very much and started such an event in Bonn. Our first
test-event was a success, so that we now open up the concept to anyone who
wants to join.</p>
<p>There is a <a class="reference external" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/118268893445703199868">Google+ Community Code &amp; Coffee Bonn</a> where you can
join and get regular invites to the events.</p>
<p>Our next event is on March 26th. For more details see the Google+ page.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you there!</p>
