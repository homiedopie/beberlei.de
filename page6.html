<h1><a href="2009/01/23/zend-form-and-the-model-yet-another-perspective-using-a-mediator.html">Zend_Form and the Model: Yet another perspective using a Mediator</a></h1>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew">Matthew Weier O’Phinney</a> of the
Zend Framework Devteam <a class="reference external" href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/200-Using-Zend_Form-in-Your-Models.html">wrote a controversial post on integrating
Zend_Form and the Model last
month</a>.
He separated concerns of view and model that communicate via a Form, by
calling just thee validation functions on the Form inside the mode. On
request you could retrieve the model to the controller and view layers.
I already wrote into his comments that I didn’t like the solution
because it relies on implicit rules for the developers to use the Form
component correctly in all layers. Additionally the building of the form
using this approach would be performed inside the model, although
strictly speaking this is responsibility of the View Layer. Another
negative point is duplication of input filtering code that has to be
performed to use certain variables inside the controller or when
different forms talk with the same model.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://codeutopia.net">Jani</a> took it up and <a class="reference external" href="http://codeutopia.net/blog/2009/01/07/another-idea-for-using-models-with-forms">proposed writing
validators for forms and attaching them to the
Form</a>
as sort of a mediator. I am not a fan of this approach either, because
the validator would have to include domain logic but is not really a
part of the domain logic anymore but just a validator. Developers might
forget using the validator inside the model for all their actions or
there would be duplication of code in some places. In a perfect world,
only functions of the models public interface should be called for
validation.</p>
<p>My personal favorite for Form and Model integration is a <strong>mediator</strong>
object between the two layers. Your model will have to include an
additional interface with one function <strong>acceptFormRequest($values);</strong>
which accepts an array of validated Zend Form field values. It then
tries to apply the validated data into a record. Additional required
validations of the model can take place in this function, which
separates the concerns of Form validation and Model data validation.
Still the mediator merges those differences together: You can throw an
Exception and it will be attached as a custom error message to the Form.
The following very short code will show the required interface and the
mediator code. This code is very simple and might produce maintenance
overhead fast, but I propose some refactoring enhancements later in the
discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>interface WW_Model_AcceptFormRequest
{
    /**
     * Acceept a form request
     * @param array $values
     * @return WW_Record_Interface
     */
    public function acceptFormRequest($values);
}
class WW_Model_FormMediator
{
    /**
     * Try to push the form request to the model
     *
     * @param Zend_Form $form
     * @param WW_Model_AcceptFormRequest $model
     * @return WW_Record_Interface
     */
    public function pushFormToModel(Zend_Form $form, WW_Model_AcceptFormRequest $model)
    {
        if(!$form-&gt;isValid()) {
            throw new Exception(&quot;Form not valid!&quot;);
        } else {
            $values = $form-&gt;getValues();
            try {
                $record = $model-&gt;acceptFormRequest($values);
            } catch(Exception $e) {
                // This exception message comes from the model, because validation failed
                $form-&gt;addErrorMessage($e-&gt;getMessage());
                throw new Exception(&quot;Form request not accepted by model!&quot;);
            }
        }
        return $record;
    }
}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You can see the mediator has two different stages where errors can
occur: When the form is not valid or the model is not valid. Both exits
can be catched inside the controller and are the indicator that the form
has to be displayed again for further input corrections. When successful
the model returns a valid record that applies to the form and model
requirements and can be displayed. If this record should be persistent
this would have been done inside the <strong>acceptFormRequest</strong> function
already. An example using a very simple Model using the a BankAccount
example. We have a form that validates all the incoming request data for
a withdrawal of money, though does not validate it against the models
internal state. Our BankAccountModel implements the
<strong>WW_Model_AcceptFormRequest</strong> interface and returns a valid
BankAccount. If found the given amount is withdrawn.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>class BankAccountModel implements WW_Model_AcceptFormRequest {
    public function acceptFormRequest($values)
    {
        $bankAccount = $this-&gt;getBankAccountBy($values['bankAccountNumber'], $values['pin']);
        if($values['action'] == &quot;withdraw&quot;) {
            $bankAccount-&gt;withdraw($values['amount']);
            $this-&gt;save($bankAccount);
        } else {
            // unknown action...
        }
    }
    public function getBankAccountBy($key, $password) {
        // Find by Primary Key returning 'BankAccount' instance or exception if not found.
    }
    public function save(BankAccount $ba) {
        // Sql for saving the Bank Account
    }
}

class BankAccount
{
    public function withdraw($amount)
    {
        if( ($this-&gt;getBalance()-$amount) &lt; 0 ) {
            throw new Exception(&quot;You cannot withdraw more money than your bank account holds!&quot;);
        }
        $this-&gt;balance -= $amount;
    }
}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Two exceptions might be thrown in this case: The Bank Account number
does not exist or the password is wrong. Or you are not allowed to
withdraw the given amount of money. If any of those exceptions is thrown
the Model does not accept the form data and the form will have to be
displayed again for the client showing the new error message that was
returned from the model. The controller handling this process would look
like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>class BankAccountController extends Zend_Controller_Action {
    public function performWithdrawlAction() {
        $form = new BankAccountWithdrawlForm(); // extends Zend_Form and builds the form

        if($this-&gt;getRequest()-&gt;isPost()) {
            $mediator         = new WW_Model_FormMediator();
            $bankAccountModel = new BankAccountModel();
            try {
                $bankAccount = $mediator-&gt;pushFormToModel($form, $bankAccountModel);

                $this-&gt;view-&gt;assign('bankAccount', $bankAccount); // Show new balance in view!
            } catch(Exception $e) {
                $this-&gt;view-&gt;assign('withdrawlForm', $form);
                $this-&gt;_redirect('showWithdrawl');
            }
        } else {
            $this-&gt;view-&gt;assign('withdrawlForm', $form);
            $this-&gt;_redirect('showWithdrawl');
        }
    }
}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You can see the mediator tightly integrates Form and Model without both
components knowing too much of each other. Still you can add error
messages received from the model into the Form and redisplay it. One
negative point of this approach is the fact that you only have one
method for accepting form data, which could result in variable checking
and redispatching in the case of many different operations that can be
performed on the same model. For this case you might want to either:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Rewrite the mediator to accept a specific model class (not the
interface) and call the required custom method that matches the forms
request. (Best approach for separation concerns)</li>
<li>Rewrite the mediator to also pass the <strong>get_class($form);</strong> value to
the model for decision making (Faster approach)</li>
</ol>
<p>There is still some overhead on using the mediator. Since its generic
you could build an Action Helper for it and use the direct call
mechanism to save some lines of code.</p>

<h1><a href="2009/01/14/finally-zend-mail-charset-and-or-long-lines-header-encoding-bug-fixed.html">Finally: Zend_Mail charset and/or long lines header encoding bug fixed</a></h1>
<p>There was this <a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-1688">lurking bug in
Zend_Mail</a> which
destroyed every Mail-Header (and corresponding Mail) with non US-ASCII
Chars and more than an encoded length of 74 chars. This is quite a huge
subset of mails, but it seems a nice solution was not so easy, at least
nobody tried to fixed it for quite some time.</p>
<p>Where many hackish solutions we’re offered, Ota Mares aka Littlex spent
incredible time to hunt the original problem down and with his help I
tag-teamed the bug to death today. Saturo Yoshida of Zend Fame added
some further spice regarding an alternative solution with Base64
Encoding instead of Quoted Printable Mime Header encoding.</p>
<p>In the end the solution we chose was, not to re-use the Mime encoding
function that is specific to MIME bodies according to
<a class="reference external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045">RFC2045</a>, but to write a
completely new algorithm for Mime Headers, whose rules are specified in
<a class="reference external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047">RFC2047</a>. This is now done and
unit-tests prove its working according to standard.</p>
<p>What is missing now is people trying that fix on as many Mail platforms
as possible and <a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-1688">giving feedback in the
issue</a> if a lengthy
subject with non-ASCII chars is displayed correctly.</p>

<h1><a href="2009/01/11/howto-file-a-good-bug-report-suggestions-for-framework-users.html">Howto file a good bug report: Suggestions for framework users</a></h1>
<p>I have fixed quite a number of bugs for the ZF lately, which lead me to
this post about how to file a good bug report. There are many annoying
bug reports out there, where the reporter of the bug withholds important
information to the bugfixer unintended. This advice applies bug reports
in general of course.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of a good bug report? The bug generally gets fixed
faster, when the developer has more information at hand. Additionally
other developers might come to rescue since they can understand the
issue faster. These benefits are good for both parties. If you take no
time for a good bug report, your issue might risk to end up getting old
or closed unfixed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Post the whole Exception Stack Trace</strong>: If the library throws an
Exception into your application that is unexpected and may indicate
an bug: Do not post the Message or Exception name only. The exception
may be thrown in many different places or due to different reasons.
The PHP exception class offers the method <strong>getTraceAsString()</strong>,
which offers many information to the developer what the cause of the
exception might be. Please use it!</li>
<li><strong>Post codefixes in a patch format</strong>: When you find a bug in the
framework, it is quite possible that you can offer a fix directly.
Writing “Replace x in line y with z” does not help very often. The
component might be in flux and the line positions change more often
than you think. Please create a diff file of this changes that
indicate the precise position of the change. This diff also includes
2 lines above and below the patched code for direction of the
developer. SVN Diffs are even more useful since they include the
revision where you fixed the bug in.</li>
<li><strong>Post reproducible cases as PHPUnit Test</strong>: If you find a bug and
can show how to reproduce it: Write a unittest to prove it. It is ZF
policy to create a unittest for each bugfix showing that the bug was
indeed fixed and previous functionality remains the same, so this
unit-test has to be written anyways. Many show-offs rely on massive
<strong>echo</strong> statements or <strong>var_dump</strong>, which render them almost
useless for the developer.</li>
<li><strong>Attach a unit-test to a submitted patch</strong>: This is related to the
previous point. If you add a unit test your patch will get more
attention. It will prove that you have thought about the patch, its
consequences and that you might have checked it does not break
backwards compatibility. This is worth a lot.</li>
<li><strong>Run the test suite with your patch</strong>: If you want to provide a
patch. Run the testsuite of the Zend Framework. It might break
expected behaviour. When you post a patch that will break BC, it will
be recognized. Your bug report might be closed, which helps nobody.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you find a bug you have probably thought about it and how to fix
it. This is valuable information. Disregarding one of this points will
lead to missing information on part of the developer that he has to
“learn” again. This takes time, which may make your bug last longer than
it should.</p>

<h1><a href="2009/01/11/what-will-be-new-in-zf-1-8.html">What will be new in ZF 1.8</a></h1>
<p>In February or March 2009 the 1.8 version of the <a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend
Framework</a> is scheduled to be released. I
have contributed some stuff already regarding ZendX_JQuery and
Zend_Soap.</p>
<p>Both components have seen numerous bugfixes and I managed to get the
JQuery helper down to zero open issues. I have also taken over the
<a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Json_Expr+to+allow+Javascript+Expressions+(functions)+to+be+encoded+using+Zend_Json">Zend_Json_Expr
proposal</a>,
which will be a huge benefit to everything JSON that can be done with
ZF. Foremost it is an integral part for the jQuery component which
heavily relies on javascript callbacks.</p>
<p>The Soap Autodiscover and WSDL classes compatibility with Java and .NET
has been optimized due to great user feedback, as well as some bugfixes
to the newly added WSDL type detection strategies.</p>
<p>Additionally I went on another bug killing spree and fixed around 20-30
old bugs in a wide range of different components.</p>

<h1><a href="2009/01/12/on-publishing-webservices-within-mvc-frameworks.html">On Publishing Webservices within MVC Frameworks</a></h1>
<p>Webservices are a very important part in today’s enterprise applications.
They tie applications of different age or programming languages together
or allow applications of different subcontracters to speak to each
other. Because they use HTTP, a stateless network protocol, considerable
overhead floods the pipes when you use them, which should be minimized.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com">Martin Fowler</a> writes in his <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog">PEAA
book</a>, that if you have the
option not to use distributed objects (which are implemented via
webservice) you should not distribute them. Considerable effort has to
be brought into keeping complex webservices performant.</p>
<p>Still people make mistakes about webservices all the time (me included
for example proposing a dispatcher for the ZF that could be used for
webservices).</p>
<p>When people report problems with the Zend Soap component they often post
a stripped down example that involes their webservice being instantiated
within a controller. This is a very bad decision based on different
arguments:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Dispatching overhead</strong>: Dispatching, Routing, Pre- and
Postfiltering is costly in all frameworks. You give up the
performance of having numerous PHP scripts that act as controller on
their own. You get centralized filtering, authentication and other
benefits. But those benefits generally do not aply to XML, JSON or
SOAP requests, because you cannot parse them or access their
properties. You give up the performance of a page controller for
webservices to gain mostly nothing.</li>
<li><strong>HTTP Request uselessness</strong>: Web frameworks work with HTTP request
objects. The request of webservices facilitates HTTP to act as a far
more complex request. No framework I know off, allows to work with
the webservice requests outside the Webservice handler. What a SOAP
or XML-RPC request does in your MVC is only get passed through
numerous costly stages that offer no benefit, before it hits the
target. Only the parsing of HTTP-Headers might offer additional
benefit, but the gain is low, since they are available to PHP scripts
at no cost.</li>
<li><strong>Webservices already seperate concerns</strong>: Take the PHP SOAPServer as
an example. It is an MVC application on its own, the controlling
aspect of the SOAPServer parses the SOAP Request and sends it to the
model, a class given by the user, which in turn works and returns the
result as an SOAP Response View. You have to decouple model and view
for a webservice handler otherwise it would generate invalid
responses. Why nest a perfectly separated operation into another one?
You gain no more of this additional separation, except performance
decrease.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what are good practices to implement webservices?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use a page controller that generates no MVC overhead. In context of
the Zend Framework: Add a new php script to your web root and add a
new route into your .htaccess file that redirectes the desired
location of the webservice to the script that overwrites the standard
catch-all incoming requests to the front controller script.</li>
<li>Use the proxy pattern and the invaluable __call() method to
implement wrapper objects for authentication and session management
of the webservice. These classes can easily be reused by all
webservice page controllers of your site. If you do your homework you
can even share parts of these objects inside your Web-MVC application
to keep the code DRY. Those proxies keep authentication logic out of
your service class.</li>
<li>Use the remote facade pattern to implement a few, powerful methods
that delegate the service request to underlying domain objects. Never
ever publish direct access to domain objects with your webservices.
As a rule of thumb, talking to a webservice during a logical
operation should never involve more than one or two calls. The first
call is for data fetching, the second for data saving. Authentication
should be handled via HTTP Authentication to save an additional call.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you follow these simple rules, you should get around the performance
issues that generally come with webservices, without loosing flexibility
at all.</p>

<p>I have been tagged by
<a class="reference external" href="http://dolfschimmel.freeaqingme.com/?p=78">Freeaqingme</a> and the blog
letter machinery. So read on for seven things you probably may not know
about me.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I will get my degree in some weeks, currently intensively writting on
my thesis. My major is economics though. I probably won’t get a job
with that sooner or later. I actually don’t want to, I have a job as
programmer already.</li>
<li>One christmas many years ago (Pentium PCs to 200Mhz were the coolest
thing around) i wished and wished for a computer for playing Command
and Conquer and stuff. What i got was a 3/86 i could only run crap
with. So i had to start programming.</li>
<li>In 11th grade (7 years ago) I took part in the german computer
science olympics (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bwinf.de/uploads/media/bwi20/runde1/20bwinf.pdf">exercise still
online</a>)
using PHP and writing thousands of lines of nested aray and for loop
code and print the solution to the browser. No need to say I utterly
failed, because I didn’t know a bit about algorithms, pointers and
objects at all.</li>
<li>I have only learned about what good programming practices are (OO,
functional, whatever) really means in the last two years, spending
almost every free minute of those many i had on projects to test
around with patterns and programming styles.</li>
<li>I went to my first conference last year september, the IPC in Mainz,
getting to know lots of great people in the community.</li>
<li>I don’t have a license at all (<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.libssh2.org/index.php?/archives/122-Seven-Things.html">Reference to
Sara</a>).
I am afraid of driving cars, although I drive my bike through the
biggest crossroads in town like nuts.</li>
<li>I am a timeline oriented reader, having made me masterplans to read
both all the Discworld and Ian Rankin novels in the correct order to
not miss a single reference.</li>
</ul>
<p>Its sad that everyone I would want to tag was already tagged by someone
else, still for the head count:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<h1><a href="2009/03/11/using-zend-soap-server-and-autodiscover-in-a-controller.html">Using Zend_Soap Server and Autodiscover in a Controller</a></h1>
<p>I am in a dilemma. I have condemned the usage of Zend_Soap_Server (or
any other webservice server handler) <a class="reference external" href="http://www.whitewashing.de/blog/articles/106">inside a Model-View-Controller
application</a> before.
Still I get questions about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.whitewashing.de/blog/articles/65">my old Zend_Soap_Server and
Zend_Soap_AutoDiscover
example</a> not working in
the MVC scenario. The following example provides you with a working Soap
server inside a Zend_Controller_Action, although I discourage the use
of it and would suggest using a dedicated script outside the dispatching
process to gain multitudes of performance, which webservices often
require.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>require_once &quot;/path/to/HelloWorldService.php&quot;;

class MyDiscouragedSoapServerController extends Zend_Controller_Action
{
    public function serverAction()
    {
        $server = new Zend_Soap_Server(&quot;http://example.com/pathto/wsdl&quot;);
        $server-&gt;setClass('HelloWorldService');
        $server-&gt;handle();
    }

    public function wsdlAction()
    {
        $wsdl = new Zend_Soap_AutoDiscover();
        $wsdl-&gt;setUri('http://example.com/pathto/server');
        $wsdl-&gt;setClass('HelloWorldService');
        $wsdl-&gt;handle();
    }
}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now all you have to do is create two routes, one that makes
<strong>http://example.com/pathto/server</strong> point to
<strong>MyDiscouragedSoapServerController::serverAction</strong> and the other route
that makes <strong>http://example.com/pathto/wsdl</strong> point to
<strong>MyDiscouragedSoapServerController::wsdlAction</strong>. The wrong version
(Version Mismatch) error comes from sending a request for the WSDL file
to the actual Soap Server, which he doesn’t like.</p>

<h1><a href="2009/03/27/test-your-legacy-php-application-with-function-mocks.html">Test your Legacy PHP Application with Function Mocks!</a></h1>
<p>Much talking is going on about Unittesting, Mocks and TDD in the PHP
world. For the most this discussions surround object-oriented PHP code,
frameworks and applications.</p>
<p>Yet I would assert that the reality for PHP developers (me included) is
dealing with PHP 4, PHP 5 migrated, or non-object oriented legacy
applications which are near to impossible to bring under test. Still
this code works, is in production and needs maintenance and possibly
extension for new features.</p>
<p>For example many applications may still use <strong>mysql_*</strong> functions at
length inside their model or have multiple nested function levels
(Example: Wordpress). <a class="reference external" href="http://pecl.php.net/package/runkit">Runkit</a> to
the rescue: A PECL extension that can hack your running PHP code, such
that method or functions are repointed to execute new implementations.
Using this extension you can actually mock out internal PHP functions,
which is great to bring legacy code under test.</p>
<p>Consider this following proof of concept, <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/padraic/runkit/tree/master">using the Runkit extension
build by Padraic Brady</a>
(the one from pecl.php.net does not compile on PHP 5.2), which replaces
the functionality of <strong>mysql_query()</strong>. You have to set the following
option in your php.ini: <strong>runkit.internal_override = On</strong> for this to
work. By default only user-defined functions may be overwritten by
Runkit.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>class FunctionMocker
{
    protected $_mockedFuncBehaviourMap = array();

    public function mock($funcName, $return=null)
    {
        $newFuncCode = 'return &quot;'.$return.'&quot;;';

        $renamedName = &quot;__&quot;.$funcName.&quot;_mockOriginalCopy&quot;;
        runkit_function_copy($funcName, $renamedName);
        runkit_function_redefine($funcName, '', $newFuncCode);

        $this-&gt;_mockedFuncBehaviourMap[$funcName] = $renamedName;
    }

    public function reset()
    {
        foreach($this-&gt;_mockedFuncBehaviourMap AS $funcName =&gt; $renamedName) {
            runkit_function_remove($funcName);
            runkit_function_copy($renamedName, $funcName);
            runkit_function_remove($renamedName);
        }
        $this-&gt;_mockedFuncBehaviourMap = array();
    }
}

$mocker = new FunctionMocker();
$mocker-&gt;mock('mysql_query', 'hello world!');

echo mysql_query(); // hello world

$mocker-&gt;reset();

mysql_query(); // error
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This example, only allows for string return values of the mock and
has no support for replacing the arguments of the mocked function.
Also chaining of different return values based on input or call
number might be interesting. Some kind of Code Generator Tool would
have to be implemented to support this functionality. Additionally
Assertions and Verifying should be implemented for the function
arguments. All in all this would allow to mock functions as you
would mock interfaces/classes, which would be a great addition for
all those legacy applications that use procedural PHP.</p>
<p>Additionally what the real killer for runkit would be: The
possibility to insert PHP callbacks instead of real PHP code into
the <strong>runkit_function_redefine</strong>.</p>

<h1><a href="2009/03/10/speaking-about-framework-quality-on-the-ipc-spring-09.html">Speaking about Framework Quality on the IPC Spring 09</a></h1>
<p>Just a short notice, my thesis is taking its last breath, I will be
speaking on the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.phpconference.com">IPC Spring 09
conference</a> in Berlin end of may this
year on Framework Quality and Unittests:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Framework Quality: Unit-Tests as silent witness</strong></dt>
<dd>Unit-Tests are often overlooked in framework discussions that focus</dd>
</dl>
<p>on features, performance, tools or database abstraction. However
they are a silent witness on how poor or well frameworks are
designed. In this presentation we will look at the testsuites of the
big players in the PHP framework business - Zend Framework,
ezComponents, Symfony and CakePHP - and reveal their hidden secrets.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This talk will make heavy use of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei/puma/tree">PHP Unittest and Metrics
Aggregator tool</a>, which i haven
written on several times. For both CakePHP and Symfony extensions for
their testtools may have to be written.</p>
<p>I am really excited for my first time being speaker on a conference and
looking forward to see you at IPC.</p>

<h1><a href="2009/10/05/php-codesniffer-for-netbeans-v0-2.html">PHP CodeSniffer for Netbeans v0.2</a></h1>
<p>I finally found some time to spend some time on the <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/beberlei/netbeans-php-enhancements">PHP CodeSniffer for
Netbeans
plugin</a>.
Previously the plugin used an unnecessary API which restricted the use
to Netbeans 6.7.0 only. This API was removed so that the plugin should
now work with all Netbeans Versions &gt;= 6.7.0.</p>
<p>Additionally when working the previous version would scan every PHP
script on a file per file basis when the all projects or main projects
filters were activated. This rendered made the plugin almost useless. In
the current version scans of filters that contain more than one file are
blocked. That means you will only see Coding Violations when you enable
the “Current File” filter. Using any other filter will just do nothing
and won’t put your Netbeans in permanent hibernation mode (aka useless
mode).</p>
<p>There is also some preference <strong>“phpcs.codingStandard”</strong> using the
<strong>`NbPreferences
API &lt;http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util/org/openide/util/NbPreferences.html&gt;`_</strong>
which allows to configure the coding standard. [STRIKEOUT:However this
feature was contributed by <a class="reference external" href="http://manuel-pichler.de">Manuel
Piechler</a> and I don’t yet understand how I
can manipulate it. Maybe someone knows how (*Looking in Mapis general
direction*)?] By default the Zend Coding Standard is used.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Coding Standard can be changed by hacking into the config
file .netbeans/6.7/config/Preferences.properties setting
“phpcs.CodingStandard=”. Additionally I fixed several bugs with the
inline highlighting that did not refresh when lines in the file changed.</p>
